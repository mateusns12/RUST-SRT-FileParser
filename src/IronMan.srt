1
00:01:26,873 --> 00:01:29,267
I feel like you're driving me
to court martial, this is crazy.

2
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:30,281
What did I do?

3
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,229
I feel like you're gonna
pull over and snuff me.

4
00:01:32,231 --> 00:01:33,418
What, you're not allowed to talk?

5
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,620
Hey, Forest?

6
00:01:34,839 --> 00:01:35,783
We can talk, sir.

7
00:01:36,982 --> 00:01:38,088
I see. So it's personal?

8
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:39,817
No, you intimidate them.

9
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:41,024
Dear God, you're a woman!

10
00:01:41,387 --> 00:01:42,845
I honestly, I couldn't have called that.

11
00:01:42,988 --> 00:01:45,500
I mean, I would apologize but
isn't that what we're going for here?

12
00:01:45,603 --> 00:01:47,195
I thought of you as a soldier first.

13
00:01:47,197 --> 00:01:48,090
I'm an airman.

14
00:01:48,368 --> 00:01:51,099
Well you have actually excellent
bone structure there. I'm kinda...

15
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:53,959
having a hard time not looking
at you now. Is that weird?

16
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:56,375
Come on, it's ok, laugh. Hey!

17
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:58,961
Sir, I have a question to ask.
Yes, please.

18
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,450
It is true you went 12 for 12
with last year's Maxim cover models?

19
00:02:02,631 --> 00:02:04,135
That is an excellent question.

20
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:06,801
Yes and no. March and I had
a scheduling conflict

21
00:02:06,803 --> 00:02:08,643
but fortunately the
Christmas cover was twins.

22
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,512
Anything else?

23
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:12,594
You're kidding me
with a hand up, right?

24
00:02:12,596 --> 00:02:14,197
Is it cool if I take a picture with you?

25
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,193
Yes, it's very cool.

26
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,261
I don't wanna see this
on your MySpace page.

27
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:24,922
Please, no gang signs.

28
00:02:25,361 --> 00:02:26,655
No, throw it up, I'm kidding.

29
00:02:26,954 --> 00:02:28,495
Yeah, peace! I love peace.

30
00:02:28,661 --> 00:02:30,120
I'd be outta job with peace.

31
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:31,666
Come on! Come on!

32
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:34,242
Just click it, don't change
the settings, just click it.

33
00:02:39,582 --> 00:02:40,616
What's going on?

34
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:41,715
Contact left!

35
00:02:41,717 --> 00:02:42,833
What have we got?

36
00:02:44,803 --> 00:02:46,342
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

37
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:48,420
Stay down!
Yeah.

38
00:02:54,326 --> 00:02:55,400
Son of a bitch!

39
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:59,008
Wait, wait, wait!
Give me a gun!

40
00:02:59,010 --> 00:02:59,783
Stay here!

41

00:06:09,184 --> 00:06:11,113
<i>Thank you, Colonel.
Thanks for the save.</i>

74
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:14,201
<i>This is beautiful. Thank you.</i>

<i>The best thing about Tony,</i>

83
00:06:36,865 --> 00:06:38,668
<i>is also the worst thing.</i>

84
00:06:38,922 --> 00:06:40,194
<i>He's always working.</i>

85
00:06:42,426 --> 00:06:43,233
Work it!

86
00:06:44,992 --> 00:06:45,812
Come on!

87
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:50,851
We should just stay
till the morning.

88
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:52,954
You are unbelievable.

89
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:53,930
Oh, no!

90
00:06:53,932 --> 00:06:56,273
Did they rope you into this?
Nobody roped me into anything!

91
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:57,677
I'm so sorry.
But they told me that

92
00:06:57,679 --> 00:07:00,306
if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.

93
00:07:00,402 --> 00:07:02,362
Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you, that's great.

94
00:07:00,402 --> 00:07:01,960
Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you.

95
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:02,979
That's great, so when do we do it?

96
00:07:03,082 --> 00:07:04,498
It's right here.
One more...

97
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,095
Here you go.
There it is. That was easy.

98
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,879
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, it's ok.

99
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:10,245
Would you look at that?
That's... That's something else.

100
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:11,927
I don't have any of
those floating around.

101
00:07:11,929 --> 00:07:13,022
We're gonna let it ride!

102
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:16,890
Give me a hand, will you?
Give me a little something.

103
00:07:17,335 --> 00:07:18,443
Ok, you too.

104
00:07:18,628 --> 00:07:20,422
I don't blow on a man's dice.
Come on, honey bear.

105
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:23,049
There it is.
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...

106
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:24,424
Two craps. Line away.

107
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:26,306
That's what happens.
Worse things have happened.

108
00:07:26,308 --> 00:07:28,102
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, William.

109
00:07:28,305 --> 00:07:29,417
This is where I exit.
Alright.

110
00:07:29,431 --> 00:07:30,432
Tomorrow, don't be late.

111
00:07:30,474 --> 00:07:31,767
Yeah, you can count on it.
I'm serious!

112
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:32,561
I know, I know.

113
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:35,771
Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's.
There you go.

114
00:07:41,109 --> 00:07:42,199
Mr. Stark!

115
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:43,474
Excuse me, Mr. Stark!

116
00:07:43,737 --> 00:07:46,042
Christine Everhart,
Vanity Fair magazine.

117
00:07:46,073 --> 00:07:47,226
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

118
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,492
She's cute.
She's alright?

119
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:49,779
Hi.
Hi.

120
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:51,647
Yeah. Ok, go.
It's ok?

121
00:07:51,953 --> 00:07:53,673
You've been called
the Da Vinci of our time.

122
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,499
What do you say to that?
Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.

123
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:58,376
And what do you say
to your other nickname?

124
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,460
The Merchant of Death?

125
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:00,635
That's not bad.

126
00:08:01,838 --> 00:08:02,729
Let me guess.

127
00:08:03,186 --> 00:08:04,005
Berkeley?

128
00:08:04,153 --> 00:08:05,279
Brown, actually.

129
00:08:05,425 --> 00:08:07,521
Well, Ms. Brown,

130
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:10,455
it's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.

131
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:13,168
I guarantee you, the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,

132
00:08:13,187 --> 00:08:15,123
I'll start making bricks and
beams for baby hospitals.

133
00:08:15,185 --> 00:08:16,584
Rehearse that much?

134
00:08:16,587 --> 00:08:18,201
Every night in front of the
mirror before bedtime.

135
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:20,341
I can see that.
I'd like to show you first-hand.

136
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,792
All I want is a serious answer.

137
00:08:23,193 --> 00:08:25,404
Ok, here's serious.
My old man had a philosophy,

138
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,859
Peace means having a bigger
stick than the other guy.

139
00:08:27,863 --> 00:08:30,183
That's a great line coming from
the guy selling the sticks.

140
00:08:30,325 --> 00:08:31,695
My father helped defeat the Nazis.

141
00:08:31,797 --> 00:08:33,161
He worked on the Manhattan Project.

142
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,368
A lot of people, including
your professors at Brown,

143
00:08:35,872 --> 00:08:37,132
would call that being a hero.

144
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,368
And a lot of people would also
call that war profiteering.

145
00:08:39,378 --> 00:08:41,659
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved

146
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,422
by advancing medical technology

147
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:45,760
or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

148
00:08:45,924 --> 00:08:47,311
All those breakthroughs,

149
00:08:47,805 --> 00:08:49,199
military funding, honey.

150
00:08:50,804 --> 00:08:52,467
You ever lose an hour
of sleep your whole life?

151
00:08:52,693 --> 00:08:54,384
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.

152
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,594
<i>Good morning.
It's 7:00 A.M.</i>

153
00:09:10,596 --> 00:09:14,010
<i>The weather in Malibu is 72
degrees with scattered clouds.</i>

154
00:09:14,536 --> 00:09:17,471
<i>The surf conditions are fair with
waist to shoulder high lines.</i>

155
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,026
<i>High tide will be at 10:52 A.M.</i>

156
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,350
Tony?

157
00:09:40,061 --> 00:09:41,313
Hey, Tony?

158
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:05,202
<i>You are not authorized
to access this area.</i>

159
00:10:05,587 --> 00:10:07,832
Jesus.
That's Jarvis. He runs the house.

160
00:10:08,757 --> 00:10:11,426
I've got your clothes here.
They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,

161
00:10:11,428 --> 00:10:13,329
and there is a car
waiting for you outside

162
00:10:13,342 --> 00:10:15,307
that will take you
anywhere you'd like to go.

163
00:10:15,868 --> 00:10:17,827
You must be the famous Pepper Potts.

164
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,612
Indeed I am.

165
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:24,163
After all these years, Tony still has
you picking up the dry-cleaning.

166
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:27,930
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires,

167
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:30,961
including occasionally
taking out the trash.

168
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:32,447
Will that be all?

169
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:50,815
Give me an exploded view.

170
00:10:51,372 --> 00:10:54,057
<i>The compression in cylinder three
appears to be low.</i>

171
00:10:54,713 --> 00:10:55,797
Log that.

172
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:00,758
I'm gonna try again, right now.

173
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:01,979
Please don't turn down my music.

174
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:03,065
I'll keep you posted.

175
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:04,801
You are supposed to be halfway
around the world right now.

176
00:11:04,803 --> 00:11:05,768
How'd she take it?

177
00:11:06,142 --> 00:11:07,182
Like a champ.

178
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:08,796
Why are you trying
to hustle me out of here?

179
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:10,605
Your flight was scheduled
to leave an hour and a half ago.

180
00:11:10,652 --> 00:11:12,887
That's funny, I thought with it
being my plane and all,

181
00:11:12,894 --> 00:11:14,513
that it would just wait for me
to get there.

182
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:16,283
Tony, I need to speak to you
about a couple things

183
00:11:16,324 --> 00:11:17,525
before I get you out of the door.

184
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:19,826
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane

185
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:21,491
if it departs before you arrive?

186
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:22,372
Larry called.

187
00:11:22,374 --> 00:11:24,594
He's got another buyer for
the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

188
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:25,828
Do you want it?
Yes or no.

189
00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:28,294
Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

190
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:31,728
No. The Springs was actually the
neighborhood in East Hampton

191
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,089
where he lived and worked,

192
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:34,487
not spring like the season.
So?

193
00:11:34,676 --> 00:11:36,166
I think it's a fair example.

194
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:38,906
I think it's incredibly overpriced.

195
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:40,548
I need it.

196
00:11:41,214 --> 00:11:42,624
Buy it. Store it.

197
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:44,224
Ok.

198
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,813
The MIT commencement speech...
Is in June.

199
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,911
Please, don't harangue me

200
00:11:47,913 --> 00:11:50,052
about stuff that's way, way, down...
They're haranguing me so,

201
00:11:50,054 --> 00:11:51,235
I'm gonna say yes.
No.

202
00:11:51,358 --> 00:11:52,357
Deflect it and absorb it.

203
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:53,540
I need you to sign,
Don't transmit it back to me.

204
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:54,973
This before you get on the plane.
What are you trying to get rid of me for?

205
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:56,240
What, you got plans?

206
00:11:56,323 --> 00:11:57,407
As a matter of fact, I do.

207
00:11:57,506 --> 00:11:58,749
I don't like it when you have plans.

208
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:00,739
I'm allowed to have
plans on my birthday.

209
00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:01,968
It's your birthday?

210
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:02,663
Yes.

211
00:12:02,704 --> 00:12:03,919
I knew that. Already?

212
00:12:04,195 --> 00:12:07,465
Yeah. Isn't that strange?
It's the same day as last year.

213
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,820
Come on.
Get yourself something nice from me.

214
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:11,044
I already did.

215
00:12:11,422 --> 00:12:12,161
And?

216
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:13,924
Oh, it was very nice.

217
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:14,457
Yeah.

218
00:12:14,584 --> 00:12:15,697
Very tasteful.

219
00:12:15,849 --> 00:12:17,507
Thank you, Mr. Stark.

220
00:12:17,844 --> 00:12:19,129
You're welcome, Miss Potts.

221
00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:23,949
Ok.

222
00:12:42,744 --> 00:12:43,811
You're good.

223
00:12:44,748 --> 00:12:46,448
I thought I lost you back there.

224
00:12:46,915 --> 00:12:48,157
You did, sir.

225
00:12:49,213 --> 00:12:50,849
I had to cut across Mulholland.

226
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:52,504
I got you. I got you.

227
00:12:52,587 --> 00:12:53,802
What's wrong with you?

228
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:55,590
What?
Three hours.

229
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,731
I got caught doing
a piece for Vanity Fair.

230
00:12:57,926 --> 00:13:00,003
For three hours. For three hours
you got me standing here.

231
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:02,071
Waiting on you now. Let's go.
Come on.

232
00:13:03,223 --> 00:13:04,946
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

233
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:14,886
What you reading, platypus?

234
00:13:14,966 --> 00:13:15,940
Nothing.

235
00:13:15,944 --> 00:13:16,965
Come on, sour patch.

236
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:18,156
Not so.
Don't be mad.

237
00:13:18,158 --> 00:13:20,869
I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, ok?

238
00:13:21,032 --> 00:13:22,528
I said I was sorry.
Good morning, Mr. Stark.

239
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,446
You don't need to apologize to me.
I said I'm sorry.

240
00:13:23,447 --> 00:13:24,954
I'm your man.
Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...

241
00:13:24,956 --> 00:13:26,349
I'm just indifferent right now.
Hot towel?

242
00:13:26,565 --> 00:13:28,897
You don't respect yourself,
so I know you don't respect me.

243
00:13:29,022 --> 00:13:30,498
I'm just your babysitter.
I respect you.

244
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,454
So, when you need your diaper changed.

245
00:13:32,456 --> 00:13:33,141
Thank you.

246
00:13:33,143 --> 00:13:35,312
Let me know and I'll get
you a bottle, ok?

247
00:13:35,338 --> 00:13:37,167
Hey! Heat up the sake, will you?

248
00:13:37,187 --> 00:13:38,472
Thanks for reminding me.
No, I'm not talking...

249
00:13:38,592 --> 00:13:40,343
We're not drinking.
We're working right now.

250
00:13:40,347 --> 00:13:42,818
You can't have sashimi without sake.
You are constitutionally

251
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,625
incapable of being responsible.

252
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,136
It would be irresponsible not to drink.

253
00:13:46,176 --> 00:13:47,219
I'm just talking about a nightcap.

254
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:48,310
Hot sake?

255
00:13:48,351 --> 00:13:49,499
Yes, two, please.
No.

256
00:13:49,501 --> 00:13:51,387
I'm not drinking.
I don't want any.

257
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:53,300
That's what I'm talking about.

258
00:13:53,302 --> 00:13:56,316
When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,

259
00:13:56,318 --> 00:13:57,780
you know what I recognize?

260
00:13:58,195 --> 00:14:03,518
I see in that mirror that every person
that's got this uniform on got my back!

261
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:05,919
Hey, you know what?
I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...

262
00:14:05,921 --> 00:14:07,704
No, no. You don't have to be like me!

263
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,550
But you're more than what you are.

264
00:14:09,552 --> 00:14:11,393
Can you excuse me
if I'm a bit distracted here?

265
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:14,503
No! You can't be distracted right now!
Listen to me!

266
00:14:31,144 --> 00:14:31,937
General.

267
00:14:32,211 --> 00:14:33,296
Welcome, Mr. Stark.

268
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,847
We look forward
to your weapons presentation.

269
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:36,550
Thanks.

270
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,085
Is it better to be feared,

271
00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:41,601
or respected?

272
00:14:41,822 --> 00:14:42,577
I say,

273
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,830
is it too much to ask for both?

274
00:14:45,826 --> 00:14:48,617
With that in mind, I humbly
present the crown jewel

275
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,455
of Stark Industries' Freedom Line.

276
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:52,163
It's the first missile system

277
00:14:52,165 --> 00:14:54,378
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

278
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:55,371
They...

279
00:14:55,868 --> 00:14:57,231
say the best weapon...

280
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,875
is one you never have to fire.

281
00:14:58,878 --> 00:15:00,675
I respectfully disagree.

282
00:15:00,882 --> 00:15:02,062
I prefer,

283
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:05,097
the weapon you only have to fire once.

284
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,602
That's how Dad did it.

285
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:08,349
That's how America does it.

286
00:15:09,106 --> 00:15:10,996
And it's worked out pretty well so far.

287
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:12,609
Find an excuse

288
00:15:12,777 --> 00:15:15,866
to let one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you

289
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:19,074
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

290
00:15:38,253 --> 00:15:39,762
For your consideration,

291
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,841
the Jericho.

292
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:56,508
I'll be throwing one of these in with
every purchase of 500 million or more.

293
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:57,772
To peace!

294
00:15:59,566 --> 00:16:01,611
<i>Tony.</i>
Obie, what are you doing up?

295
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:04,279
<i>I couldn't sleep till I found
out how it went. How'd it go?</i>

296
00:16:04,321 --> 00:16:06,156
It went great.
Looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas.

297
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,488
<i>Hey! Way to go, my boy!</i>

298
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,079
<i>I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?</i>

299
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,620
Why aren't you wearing
those pajamas I got you?

300
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:12,937
<i>Good night, Tony.</i>

301
00:16:14,626 --> 00:16:15,497
Hey, Tony.

302
00:16:15,535 --> 00:16:17,158
I'm sorry, this is the fun-vee.

303
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,809
The hum-drum-vee is back there.

304
00:16:19,204 --> 00:16:20,392
Nice job.

305
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:21,849
See you back at base.

306
00:17:28,989 --> 00:17:30,558
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

307
00:18:07,778 --> 00:18:09,237
What the hell did you do to me?

308
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:11,467
What I did?

309
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,958
What I did is to save your life.

310
00:18:15,243 --> 00:18:17,263
I removed all the shrapnel I could,

311
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,828
but there is a lot left,

312
00:18:18,955 --> 00:18:20,707
and it's headed into
your atrial septum.

313
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:22,517
Here, want to see?

314
00:18:23,747 --> 00:18:24,900
I have a souvenir.

315
00:18:25,629 --> 00:18:26,657
Take a look.

316
00:18:29,385 --> 00:18:31,247
I've seen many wounds
like that in my village.

317
00:18:31,718 --> 00:18:33,357
We call them the walking dead

318
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:37,343
because it takes about a week for
the barbs to reach the vital organs.

319
00:18:37,345 --> 00:18:38,146
What is this?

320
00:18:38,273 --> 00:18:40,219
That is an electromagnet,

321
00:18:41,061 --> 00:18:42,547
hooked up to a car battery,

322
00:18:43,161 --> 00:18:45,665
and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.

323
00:18:54,324 --> 00:18:55,329
That's right.

324
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:56,532
Smile.

325
00:18:58,203 --> 00:18:59,317
We met once, you know,

326
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,030
at a technical conference in Bern.

327
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:03,817
I don't remember.

328
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:05,287
No, you wouldn't.

329
00:19:05,836 --> 00:19:07,056
If I had been that drunk,

330
00:19:07,097 --> 00:19:08,962
I wouldn't have been able to stand,

331
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:10,677
much less give a lecture on...

332
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:12,237
integrated circuits.

333
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:13,266
Where are we?

334
00:19:15,512 --> 00:19:17,401
Come on, stand up.
Stand up!

335
00:19:18,712 --> 00:19:20,531
Just do as I do.

336
00:19:21,101 --> 00:19:22,672
Come on, put your hands up.

337
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,456
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

338
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:27,357
Do you understand me?

339
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,316
Do as I do.

340
00:19:49,296 --> 00:19:51,144
He says, Welcome Tony Stark,

341
00:19:51,629 --> 00:19:53,509
the most famous mass murderer

342
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,037
in the history of America.

343
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,572
He is honored.

344
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:04,311
He wants you to build the missile.

345
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:08,106
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

346
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:12,986
This one.

347
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,200
I refuse.

348
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,687
<i>Tony!</i>

349
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:22,957
He wants to know what you think.

350
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:25,666
I think you got a lot of my weapons.

351
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:36,145
He says...

352
00:21:36,185 --> 00:21:38,950
they have everything you need
to build the Jericho missile.

353
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:41,658
He wants you to make
the list of materials.

354
00:21:45,544 --> 00:21:48,897
He says for you to start working
immediately and when you're done,

355
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,809
he will set you free.

356
00:21:54,436 --> 00:21:55,488
No, he won't.

357
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:57,381
No, he won't.

358
00:22:10,771 --> 00:22:12,656
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.

359
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,882
But they will never find
you in these mountains.

360
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:18,970
Look,

361
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:21,897
what you just saw,

362
00:22:22,657 --> 00:22:24,576
that is your legacy, Stark.

363
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:27,562
Your life's work,

364
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,562
in the hands of those murderers.

365
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:31,387
Is that how you want to go out?

366
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,554
Is this the last act

367
00:22:34,556 --> 00:22:37,666
of defiance of the great Tony Stark?

368
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,362
Or are you going
to do something about it?

369
00:22:40,364 --> 00:22:42,233
Why should I do anything?
They're going to kill me,

370
00:22:42,873 --> 00:22:43,667
you,

371
00:22:44,644 --> 00:22:47,400
either way and if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.

372
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:49,382
Well then...

373
00:22:50,589 --> 00:22:52,831
this is a very important
week for you, isn't it?

374
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,518
If this is going to be my work station,
I want it well-lit.

375
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,360
I want these up.

376
00:22:59,641 --> 00:23:01,103
I need welding gear.

377
00:23:01,105 --> 00:23:02,586
I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.

378
00:23:03,201 --> 00:23:04,212
I need a soldering station.

379
00:23:04,214 --> 00:23:05,566
I need helmets.
I'm gonna need goggles.

380
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:06,901
I would like a smelting cup.

381
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,600
I need two sets of precision tools.

382
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,343
How many languages do you speak?

383
00:23:23,385 --> 00:23:24,292
A lot.

384
00:23:24,553 --> 00:23:26,346
But apparently not enough
for this place.

385
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:29,391
They speak Arabic, Urdu,

386
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:30,708
Dari, Pashto,

387
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:32,813
Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.

388
00:23:34,004 --> 00:23:35,214
Who are these people?

389
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:38,398
They are your loyal customers, sir.

390
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:40,834
They call themselves the Ten Rings.

391
00:23:50,452 --> 00:23:52,031
You know, we might be more productive

392
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:54,166
if you include me in the planning process.

393
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:05,469
Ok, we don't need this.

394
00:24:07,494 --> 00:24:08,431
What is that?

395
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,931
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.

396
00:24:13,477 --> 00:24:16,486
We need at least 1.6, so why don't
you go break down the other 11?

397
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,917
What's he doing?

398
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:23,104
Working.

399
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:34,295
Careful.

400
00:24:34,513 --> 00:24:36,172
Careful, we only get one shot at this.

401
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:37,546
Relax.

402
00:24:37,836 --> 00:24:39,358
I have steady hands.

403
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:41,786
Why do you think you're still alive?

404
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,061
What do I call you?

405
00:24:50,745 --> 00:24:52,206
My name is Yinsen.

406
00:24:52,808 --> 00:24:54,643
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

407
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:57,310
Nice to meet you, too.

408
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,292
That doesn't look like
a Jericho missile.

409
00:25:40,647 --> 00:25:43,178
That's because it's a
miniaturized arc reactor.

410
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,393
I got a big one powering
my factory at home.

411
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,125
It should keep the
shrapnel out of my heart.

412
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,477
But what could it generate?

413
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:53,145
If my math is right,

414
00:25:53,147 --> 00:25:54,492
and it always is,

415
00:25:54,874 --> 00:25:56,503
three gigajoules per second.

416
00:25:56,913 --> 00:25:59,168
That could run your heart for 50 lifetimes.

417
00:25:59,366 --> 00:26:00,075
Yeah.

418
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:02,641
Or something big for 15 minutes.

419
00:26:11,592 --> 00:26:13,180
This is our ticket out of here.

420
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:14,860
What is it?

421
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:17,691
Flatten them out and look.

422
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:25,805
Impressive.

423
00:26:52,302 --> 00:26:53,176
Good.

424
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:55,064
Good roll.

425
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:56,788
Good roll.

426
00:26:57,884 --> 00:26:59,423
You still haven't told me
where you're from.

427
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:02,142
I'm from a small town called Gulmira.

428
00:27:03,105 --> 00:27:04,564
It's actually a nice place.

429
00:27:05,148 --> 00:27:06,148
Got a family?

430
00:27:06,393 --> 00:27:07,200
Yes,

431
00:27:08,031 --> 00:27:10,613
and I will see them when I leave here.

432
00:27:11,613 --> 00:27:12,705
And you Stark?

433
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:18,068
No.

434
00:27:18,954 --> 00:27:19,691
No?

435
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:23,325
So you're a man who has everything

436
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:25,444
and nothing.

437
00:28:11,632 --> 00:28:13,284
It doesn't look anything,

438
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:14,718
like the picture.

439
00:28:14,802 --> 00:28:16,402
Maybe it's been modified.

440
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:17,792
The tail is wrong.

441
00:28:17,794 --> 00:28:18,800
It's just backwards.

442
00:29:04,268 --> 00:29:05,268
Relax.

443
00:29:14,528 --> 00:29:15,852
The bow and arrow.

444
00:29:16,947 --> 00:29:19,474
Once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.

445
00:29:22,317 --> 00:29:24,342
It allowed the great Genghis Khan,

446
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,048
to rule from the Pacific,

447
00:29:27,623 --> 00:29:28,720
to the Ukraine.

448
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,195
An empire,

449
00:29:30,332 --> 00:29:32,597
twice the size of Alexander the Great,

450
00:29:34,047 --> 00:29:35,360
and four times,

451
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,472
the size of the Roman Empire.

452
00:29:41,221 --> 00:29:42,887
But today,

453
00:29:43,265 --> 00:29:46,610
whoever holds
the latest Stark weapons,

454
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:49,543
rules these lands.

455
00:29:51,984 --> 00:29:53,150
And soon,

456
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,695
it will be my turn.

457
00:30:11,139 --> 00:30:12,684
Why have you failed me?

458
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:14,835
We're working.

459
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:16,802
Diligently.

460
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,605
I let you live.

461
00:30:21,387 --> 00:30:22,798
This is how you repay me?

462
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,513
It's very complex.

463
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:29,085
He's trying very hard.

464
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:30,311
On his knees.

465
00:30:34,873 --> 00:30:36,733
You think I'm a fool?

466
00:30:37,486 --> 00:30:38,720
I'll get the truth.

467
00:30:39,628 --> 00:30:41,337
We're both working.

468
00:30:48,197 --> 00:30:49,531
Open your mouth.

469
00:30:49,755 --> 00:30:50,664
What does he want?

470
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:53,202
You think I'm a fool?

471
00:30:56,841 --> 00:30:58,170
What's going on?

472
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:01,551
Tell me the truth.

473
00:31:02,118 --> 00:31:03,392
He's building your Jericho.

474
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:04,333
Tell me the truth.

475
00:31:04,334 --> 00:31:05,778
He's building your Jericho.
Tell me the truth!

476
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:06,668
He's building your Jericho.
What do you want?

477
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,761
A delivery date? I...

478
00:31:15,796 --> 00:31:16,795
I need him.

479
00:31:19,403 --> 00:31:20,322
Good assistant.

480
00:31:25,742 --> 00:31:26,866
You have till tomorrow,

481
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:29,517
to assemble my missile.

482
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,436
Ok?
Can you move?

483
00:32:37,565 --> 00:32:38,775
Ok, say it again.

484
00:32:39,316 --> 00:32:40,929
41 steps straight ahead.

485
00:32:40,931 --> 00:32:42,058
Then 16 steps,

486
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,414
that's from the door, fork right,

487
00:32:43,697 --> 00:32:45,269
33 steps, turn right.

488
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:53,810
Where is Stark?

489
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:56,405
He was here a moment ago.

490
00:32:56,827 --> 00:32:57,726
Go look for him.

491
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:16,009
Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!

492
00:33:16,645 --> 00:33:17,462
Say something.

493
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,314
He's speak...
Say something back to him.

494
00:33:18,394 --> 00:33:19,490
He speak Hungarian.

495
00:33:19,524 --> 00:33:20,814
I don't...
Then speak hungarian.

496
00:33:20,816 --> 00:33:21,767
Ok. I know.

497
00:33:22,062 --> 00:33:22,953
What do you know?

498
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,427
How'd that work?
Oh, my goodness.

499
00:33:49,047 --> 00:33:50,611
It worked alright.
That's what I do.

500
00:33:50,804 --> 00:33:51,785
Let me finish this.

501
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:53,264
Initialize the power sequence.

502
00:33:53,807 --> 00:33:54,519
Ok.

503
00:33:55,851 --> 00:33:57,142
Now!
Tell me. Tell me.

504
00:33:57,144 --> 00:33:58,447
Function 11.

505
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,579
Tell me when you see a progress bar.

506
00:34:01,148 --> 00:34:02,509
It should be up right now.
Yes.

507
00:34:02,524 --> 00:34:03,732
Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.

508
00:34:03,734 --> 00:34:05,242
I have it.
Press Control I.

509
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:07,849
I. Got it.
I. Enter. I and Enter.

510
00:34:07,863 --> 00:34:09,187
Come over here and button me up.

511
00:34:12,701 --> 00:34:13,989
Ok. Alright.

512
00:34:13,991 --> 00:34:15,054
Every other hex bolt.

513
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:17,365
They're coming!
Nothing pretty, just get it done.

514
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:18,979
Just get it done.
They're coming.

515
00:34:21,046 --> 00:34:23,687
Make sure the checkpoints are clear
before you follow me out, ok?

516
00:34:23,712 --> 00:34:24,960
We need more time.

517
00:34:26,586 --> 00:34:27,284
Hey,

518
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:29,647
I'm gonna go buy you some time.

519
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:31,106
Stick to the plan!

520
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,709
Stick to the plan!

521
00:34:35,766 --> 00:34:36,766
Yinsen!

522
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:30,687
Yinsen!

523
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,025
Watch out!

524
00:37:47,249 --> 00:37:48,067
Stark.

525
00:37:49,709 --> 00:37:51,637
Come on. We got to go.

526
00:37:52,546 --> 00:37:54,744
Move for me, come on. We got a
plan. We're gonna stick to it.

527
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:57,364
This was always the plan, Stark.

528
00:37:57,926 --> 00:37:59,514
Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.

529
00:38:01,555 --> 00:38:03,073
My family is dead.

530
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:06,195
I'm going to see them now, Stark.

531
00:38:08,893 --> 00:38:09,875
It's ok.

532
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:13,568
I want this.

533
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:15,484
I want this.

534
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,781
Thank you for saving me.

535
00:38:24,953 --> 00:38:26,097
Don't waste it.

536
00:38:26,943 --> 00:38:28,301
Don't waste your life.

537
00:39:08,038 --> 00:39:08,952
My turn.

538
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:53,517
Not bad.

539
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,635
Hey!

540
00:41:49,157 --> 00:41:50,657
How was the fun-vee?

541
00:41:53,662 --> 00:41:55,597
Next time, you ride with me, ok?

542
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:28,677
Watch it, coming up here.

543
00:42:30,866 --> 00:42:32,281
Are you kidding me with this?

544
00:42:32,735 --> 00:42:33,742
Get rid of them.

545
00:42:42,252 --> 00:42:43,192
Your eyes are red.

546
00:42:43,796 --> 00:42:45,673
A few tears for your long-lost boss?

547
00:42:45,675 --> 00:42:48,277
Tears of joy.
I hate job hunting.

548
00:42:48,925 --> 00:42:50,083
Yeah, vacation's over.

549
00:42:52,054 --> 00:42:53,263
Where to, sir?

550
00:42:53,346 --> 00:42:54,393
Take us to the hospital,
No.

551
00:42:54,395 --> 00:42:55,448
Please Happy. No?

552
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:57,726
Tony, you have to go to the hospital.
No is a complete answer.

553
00:42:57,728 --> 00:42:59,043
The doctor has to look at you.
I don't have to do anything.

554
00:42:59,045 --> 00:43:00,574
I've been in captivity for three months.

555
00:43:00,575 --> 00:43:03,356
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger,

556
00:43:04,597 --> 00:43:06,011
and the other...
That's enough of that.

557
00:43:06,013 --> 00:43:08,234
Is not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.

558
00:43:08,236 --> 00:43:09,552
Call for a press conference?
Yeah.

559
00:43:09,554 --> 00:43:10,734
Hogan, drive.
What on earth for?

560
00:43:10,736 --> 00:43:11,952
Cheeseburger first.

561
00:43:24,586 --> 00:43:26,088
Look at this!

562
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:29,173
Tony.

563
00:43:31,631 --> 00:43:33,173
We were going to meet at the hospital.

564
00:43:33,175 --> 00:43:34,635
No, I'm fine.

565
00:43:34,638 --> 00:43:35,637
Look at you!

566
00:43:36,807 --> 00:43:39,226
You had to have a burger, yeah?
Well, come on.

567
00:43:39,267 --> 00:43:40,325
You get me one of those?

568
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:41,767
There's only one left.
I need it.

569
00:43:44,731 --> 00:43:46,462
Hey, look who's here!

570
00:43:46,909 --> 00:43:47,763
Yeah!

571
00:43:52,906 --> 00:43:54,408
Miss Potts?
Yes.

572
00:43:54,489 --> 00:43:55,720
Can I speak to you for a moment?

573
00:43:55,784 --> 00:43:58,101
I'm. I'm not part of
the press conference,

574
00:43:58,103 --> 00:43:59,432
but it's about to begin right now.

575
00:43:59,452 --> 00:44:00,624
I'm not a reporter.

576
00:44:00,872 --> 00:44:02,183
I'm agent Phil Coulson,

577
00:44:02,185 --> 00:44:04,161
with the Strategic Homeland
Intervention, Enforcement

578
00:44:04,163 --> 00:44:05,498
and Logistics Division.

579
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,165
That's quite a mouthful.

580
00:44:07,248 --> 00:44:08,797
I know. We're working on it.

581
00:44:08,799 --> 00:44:11,383
You know we've, we've been
approached already by the DOD,

582
00:44:11,385 --> 00:44:13,299
the FBI, the CIA...

583
00:44:13,301 --> 00:44:14,541
We're a separate division,

584
00:44:14,543 --> 00:44:16,635
with a more specific focus.

585
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,176
We need to debrief Mr. Stark about
the circumstances of his escape.

586
00:44:20,761 --> 00:44:22,379
I'll put something in the book, shall I?

587
00:44:22,381 --> 00:44:23,223
Thank you.

588
00:44:28,942 --> 00:44:31,430
Hey, would it be alright
if everyone sat down?

589
00:44:31,528 --> 00:44:34,402
Why don't you just sit down?
That way you can see me and I...

590
00:44:34,992 --> 00:44:36,604
A little less formal and...

591
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,373
What's up with the love in?

592
00:44:43,793 --> 00:44:44,833
Don't look at me.

593
00:44:44,875 --> 00:44:46,431
I don't know what he's up to.

594
00:44:46,963 --> 00:44:47,930
Good to see you.

595
00:44:48,295 --> 00:44:49,463
Good to see you.

596
00:44:49,504 --> 00:44:51,095
I never got to say goodbye to Dad.

597
00:44:52,174 --> 00:44:53,877
I never got to say goodbye to my father.

598
00:44:58,706 --> 00:45:00,180
There's questions that
I would have asked him.

599
00:45:00,182 --> 00:45:02,490
I would have asked him how he
felt about what this company did.

600
00:45:04,686 --> 00:45:06,894
If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

601
00:45:08,349 --> 00:45:12,177
Or maybe he was every inch the man
we all remember from the newsreels.

602
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:19,149
I saw young Americans killed

603
00:45:20,118 --> 00:45:21,567
by the very weapons,

604
00:45:21,967 --> 00:45:24,271
I created to defend them
and protect them.

605
00:45:25,527 --> 00:45:26,981
And I saw that I...

606
00:45:28,168 --> 00:45:31,642
had become part of a system that
is comfortable with zero accountability.

607
00:45:33,048 --> 00:45:34,347
Mr. Stark! Mr. Stark!
Mr. Stark.

608
00:45:34,349 --> 00:45:35,181
Hey, Ben.

609
00:45:35,704 --> 00:45:36,957
What happened over there?

610
00:45:38,595 --> 00:45:40,001
I had my eyes opened.

611
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:42,112
I came to realize that I have more

612
00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:43,311
to offer

613
00:45:43,845 --> 00:45:46,810
this world than just making
things that blow up.

614
00:45:46,812 --> 00:45:48,021
<i>And that is why,</i>

615
00:45:48,023 --> 00:45:50,153
<i>effective immediately
I am shutting down</i>

616
00:45:50,399 --> 00:45:53,235
<i>the weapons manufacturing
division of Stark International</i>

617
00:45:54,111 --> 00:45:55,444
<i>until such a time,</i>

618
00:45:55,689 --> 00:45:58,342
<i>as I can decide what the future
of the company will be.</i>

619
00:45:58,344 --> 00:45:59,950
<i>I think we're gonna be
selling a lot of newspapers.</i>

620
00:46:00,033 --> 00:46:01,743
<i>What direction it should take,
one that I'm comfortable with</i>

621
00:46:01,785 --> 00:46:04,135
<i>and is consistent with the highest
good</i>

622
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,497
<i>for this country, as well.</i>

623
00:46:07,105 --> 00:46:09,434
<i>What we should take away from this,</i>

624
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:12,037
<i>is that Tony's back!</i>

625
00:46:12,301 --> 00:46:14,569
<i>And he's healthier than ever.</i>

626
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:18,289
<i>We're going to have a
little internal discussion</i>

627
00:46:18,291 --> 00:46:20,424
<i>and we'll get back
to you with the follow-up.</i>

628
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:23,598
Where is he?

629
00:46:24,131 --> 00:46:25,060
He's inside.

630
00:46:36,069 --> 00:46:37,507
Well, that...

631
00:46:37,509 --> 00:46:38,906
That went well.

632
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:41,116
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

633
00:46:41,293 --> 00:46:42,290
Your head?

634
00:46:42,292 --> 00:46:43,629
What about my head?

635
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:47,035
What do you think the over-under on
the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?

636
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:48,580
Optimistically, 40 points.

637
00:46:48,816 --> 00:46:50,109
At minimum.

638
00:46:50,459 --> 00:46:51,359
Yep.

639
00:46:51,793 --> 00:46:52,696
Tony,

640
00:46:53,206 --> 00:46:55,145
we're a weapons manufacturer.

641
00:46:55,153 --> 00:46:56,175
Obie I just,
Don't

642
00:46:56,199 --> 00:46:57,178
I don't want a body count

643
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,781
to be our only legacy. That's it.
That's what we do.

644
00:46:58,783 --> 00:47:00,514
We're iron mongers.
We make weapons.

645
00:47:00,516 --> 00:47:01,887
It's my name on the side
of the building.

646
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:04,426
And what we do keeps the world
from falling into chaos.

647
00:47:04,493 --> 00:47:06,036
Not based on what I saw.

648
00:47:07,643 --> 00:47:09,055
We're not doing a good enough job.

649
00:47:09,057 --> 00:47:10,127
We can do better.
We're gonna do something else.

650
00:47:10,129 --> 00:47:11,040
Like what?

651
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,984
You want us to make baby bottles?

652
00:47:14,066 --> 00:47:16,838
I think we should take another
look into arc reactor technology.

653
00:47:17,498 --> 00:47:18,287
Come on.

654
00:47:18,813 --> 00:47:21,777
The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

655
00:47:21,852 --> 00:47:22,924
Tony, come on.

656
00:47:22,926 --> 00:47:25,027
We built that thing to shut the hippies up!

657
00:47:25,243 --> 00:47:25,888
It works.

658
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:28,503
Yeah, as a science project.

659
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:30,357
The arc was never cost effective.

660
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:31,938
We knew that before we built it.

661
00:47:32,209 --> 00:47:35,381
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

662
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,312
Maybe.

663
00:47:36,776 --> 00:47:39,361
Am I right? We haven't had
a breakthrough in that in what?

664
00:47:39,903 --> 00:47:41,618
30 years.
That's what they say.

665
00:47:44,937 --> 00:47:47,180
Could you have a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

666
00:47:47,182 --> 00:47:48,377
Never mind who told me.
Who told you?

667
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:49,175
Show me.
Rhodey?

668
00:47:49,177 --> 00:47:50,455
Rhodey or Pepper?
It's Rhodey or Pepper.

669
00:47:50,477 --> 00:47:52,123
I want to see it.
Ok, Rhodey.

670
00:48:01,196 --> 00:48:02,656
Ok. Alright

671
00:48:06,034 --> 00:48:07,055
It works.

672
00:48:11,373 --> 00:48:12,514
Listen to me, Tony.

673
00:48:13,841 --> 00:48:15,625
We're a team. Do you understand?

674
00:48:15,627 --> 00:48:18,914
There's nothing we can't
do if we stick together,

675
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:20,083
like your father and I.

676
00:48:20,465 --> 00:48:22,259
I'm sorry I didn't give
you a heads-up, ok?

677
00:48:22,342 --> 00:48:23,798
But if I had...
Tony.

678
00:48:23,969 --> 00:48:27,013
Tony, no more of this ready,
fire, aim business.

679
00:48:27,055 --> 00:48:28,838
You understand me?
That was Dad's line.

680
00:48:30,392 --> 00:48:32,209
You got to let me handle this.

681
00:48:32,644 --> 00:48:35,063
We're gonna have to play a whole
different kind of ball now.

682
00:48:35,065 --> 00:48:36,900
We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

683
00:48:36,979 --> 00:48:40,217
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

684
00:48:40,569 --> 00:48:42,227
<i>Stark Industries!</i>

685
00:48:42,404 --> 00:48:45,282
<i>I've got one recommendation!
Ready? Ready?</i>

686
00:48:45,771 --> 00:48:46,689
<i>Sell, sell, sell!</i>

687
00:48:46,742 --> 00:48:48,744
<i>Abandon ship!</i>

688
00:48:48,785 --> 00:48:52,069
<i>Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?</i>

689
00:48:53,424 --> 00:48:58,532
<i>Let me show you the new Stark
Industries business plan!</i>

690
00:49:00,088 --> 00:49:03,639
<i>Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!</i>

691
00:49:04,885 --> 00:49:07,464
<i>Pepper.
How big are your hands?</i>

692
00:49:07,929 --> 00:49:09,649
What?
<i>How big are your hands?</i>

693
00:49:10,187 --> 00:49:12,673
I don't understand why...
<i>Get down here. I need you.</i>

694
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:21,244
Hey.

695
00:49:23,612 --> 00:49:24,506
Let's see them.
Show me your hands.

696
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:26,631
Let's see them.

697
00:49:27,483 --> 00:49:29,638
Oh. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

698
00:49:30,577 --> 00:49:32,654
I just need your help for a sec.

699
00:49:33,914 --> 00:49:36,164
Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

700
00:49:36,166 --> 00:49:38,791
It was. It is now an antique.

701
00:49:39,544 --> 00:49:42,460
This is what will be keeping me
alive for the foreseeable future.

702
00:49:42,462 --> 00:49:44,341
I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit,

703
00:49:44,343 --> 00:49:46,880
and I just ran into a little speed bump.

704
00:49:47,302 --> 00:49:48,760
Speed bump, what does that mean?

705
00:49:48,762 --> 00:49:50,136
It's nothing.
It's just a little snag.

706
00:49:50,138 --> 00:49:51,143
There's an exposed,

707
00:49:51,525 --> 00:49:53,581
wire under this device.

708
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,822
And it's contacting the socket wall
and causing a little bit of a short.

709
00:49:56,852 --> 00:49:57,318
It's...

710
00:49:58,175 --> 00:49:58,942
fine.

711
00:49:58,988 --> 00:50:00,970
What? What do you want me to do?
Put that on the table over there.

712
00:50:00,972 --> 00:50:03,105
That is irrelevant.
Oh, my God!

713
00:50:03,235 --> 00:50:04,526
I want you to reach in,

714
00:50:04,528 --> 00:50:06,608
and you're just gonna gently
lift the wire out.

715
00:50:08,323 --> 00:50:09,299
Is it safe?

716
00:50:09,301 --> 00:50:10,487
Yeah, it should be fine.

717
00:50:10,489 --> 00:50:12,359
It's like operation.
You just don't let it touch

718
00:50:12,366 --> 00:50:14,021
the socket wall or it goes beep.
What's operati...

719
00:50:14,022 --> 00:50:15,991
What do you mean operation?
It's just a game, never mind.

720
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:18,033
Just gently lift the wire.
Ok?

721
00:50:18,779 --> 00:50:20,164
Ok. Great.

722
00:50:22,045 --> 00:50:22,879
You know, I. I...

723
00:50:23,132 --> 00:50:24,710
I don't think that
I'm qualified to do this.

724
00:50:24,712 --> 00:50:25,585
No, you're fine.

725
00:50:25,812 --> 00:50:28,478
You're the most capable, qualified,

726
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,793
trustworthy person I've ever met.

727
00:50:30,795 --> 00:50:32,252
You're gonna do great.

728
00:50:33,557 --> 00:50:35,422
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
Because I'm... I'm...

729
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,189
Ok, ok.
I really need your help here.

730
00:50:38,353 --> 00:50:39,243
Ok.

731
00:50:43,775 --> 00:50:45,483
Oh, there is pus!

732
00:50:45,485 --> 00:50:50,115
It's not pus. It's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device,

733
00:50:50,198 --> 00:50:52,198
not from my body.
It smells!

734
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,282
Yeah, it does.

735
00:50:54,077 --> 00:50:55,070
The copper wire.

736
00:50:55,577 --> 00:50:56,870
The copper wire, you got it?
Ok.

737
00:50:56,872 --> 00:50:58,037
I got it! I got it!
Ok, you got it?

738
00:50:58,039 --> 00:50:59,232
Now, don't let it touch...

739
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:01,001
the sides, sides when you're coming out!

740
00:51:01,042 --> 00:51:01,729
That's what I was...
I'm sorry.

741
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:03,158
Trying to tell you before.
I'm sorry.

742
00:51:03,571 --> 00:51:05,408
Ok, now make sure that when
you pull it out, you don't pull...

743
00:51:05,673 --> 00:51:07,722
There's a magnet at the end of it!
That was it.

744
00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:08,842
You just pulled it out.

745
00:51:08,884 --> 00:51:09,971
Oh, God! Ok.
Ok, I was not...

746
00:51:09,973 --> 00:51:11,714
What do I do?
Expecting, don't put it back in!

747
00:51:12,346 --> 00:51:13,170
What's wrong?

748
00:51:13,172 --> 00:51:15,134
Nothing, I'm just going into
cardiac arrest because

749
00:51:15,136 --> 00:51:17,565
you yanked it out like a trout...
What? You said it was safe!

750
00:51:17,581 --> 00:51:19,140
We got to hurry. Take this. Take this.
Ok.

751
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:20,366
You got to switch it out really quick.
Ok. Ok.

752
00:51:20,647 --> 00:51:21,302
Ok.

753
00:51:21,396 --> 00:51:22,293
Tony?
What?

754
00:51:22,294 --> 00:51:23,235
It's going to be ok.

755
00:51:23,236 --> 00:51:24,537
Is it?
It's gonna be ok.

756
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,482
Let's hope.
I'm gonna make this ok.

757
00:51:27,569 --> 00:51:28,787
Ok, you're gonna attach that,
Ok.

758
00:51:28,789 --> 00:51:29,842
To the base plate.

759
00:51:30,143 --> 00:51:32,452
And make sure you...

760
00:51:35,744 --> 00:51:36,851
Was that so hard?

761
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:38,155
That was fun, right?

762
00:51:38,246 --> 00:51:39,790
Here, I got it. I got it.
Here.

763
00:51:40,457 --> 00:51:41,541
Nice.

764
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:43,540
Are you ok?
Yeah, I feel great.

765
00:51:43,919 --> 00:51:44,673
You ok?

766
00:51:46,588 --> 00:51:49,508
Don't ever, ever, ever,

767
00:51:49,591 --> 00:51:52,482
ever, ask me to do anything
like that ever again.

768
00:51:52,636 --> 00:51:54,513
I don't have anyone but you.

769
00:52:00,435 --> 00:52:01,435
Anyway...

770
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:08,859
What do you want me
to do with this?

771
00:52:08,902 --> 00:52:09,609
That?

772
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:11,924
Destroy it.

773
00:52:12,989 --> 00:52:14,047
Incinerate it.

774
00:52:15,063 --> 00:52:16,498
You don't want to keep it?

775
00:52:16,762 --> 00:52:18,476
Pepper, I've been called many things.

776
00:52:18,478 --> 00:52:20,144
Nostalgic is not one of them.

777
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:22,958
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?

778
00:52:22,999 --> 00:52:24,447
That will be all, Miss Potts.

779
00:52:25,961 --> 00:52:27,214
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

780
00:52:27,796 --> 00:52:29,715
What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?

781
00:52:29,798 --> 00:52:30,904
That's my phone,

782
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,737
that's a picture of me and my dad.

783
00:52:33,051 --> 00:52:35,679
Right there. In the garbage.
All that stuff.

784
00:52:42,144 --> 00:52:44,352
The future of air combat.

785
00:52:44,635 --> 00:52:46,649
Is it manned or unmanned?

786
00:52:46,732 --> 00:52:48,510
I'll tell you in my experience,

787
00:52:48,942 --> 00:52:53,481
no unmanned aerial vehicle will
ever trump a pilot's instinct,

788
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:55,301
his insight,

789
00:52:55,407 --> 00:52:58,485
that ability to look into a
situation beyond the obvious

790
00:52:58,493 --> 00:52:59,991
and discern its outcome,

791
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:02,085
or a pilot's judgment.

792
00:53:02,247 --> 00:53:03,260
Colonel?

793
00:53:03,457 --> 00:53:04,916
Why not a pilot without the plane?

794
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:07,616
Look who fell out of the sky.
Mr. Tony Stark.

795
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,411
Hello, sir.
Speaking of manned or unmanned,

796
00:53:09,421 --> 00:53:11,701
you got to get him to tell you about the time
he guessed wrong at spring break.

797
00:53:11,871 --> 00:53:14,010
Just remember that,
spring break, 1987.

798
00:53:14,051 --> 00:53:15,425
That lovely lady you woke up with.
Don't do that!

799
00:53:15,427 --> 00:53:16,749
What was his name?
Don't do that.

800
00:53:16,887 --> 00:53:18,053
Was it Ivan?
Don't do that.

801
00:53:18,055 --> 00:53:19,336
They'll believe it. Don't do that.

802
00:53:19,347 --> 00:53:20,547
Ok.
Don't do that.

803
00:53:20,549 --> 00:53:22,768
Pleasure meeting you.
Give us a couple minutes, you guys.

804
00:53:26,449 --> 00:53:27,947
I'm surprised.
Why?

805
00:53:28,334 --> 00:53:30,891
I swear, I didn't expect to see
you walking around so soon.

806
00:53:31,109 --> 00:53:32,520
I'm doing a little better than walking.

807
00:53:32,981 --> 00:53:34,038
Really?
Yeah.

808
00:53:35,197 --> 00:53:36,716
Rhodey, I'm working on something big.

809
00:53:37,991 --> 00:53:39,145
I came to talk to you.

810
00:53:39,364 --> 00:53:40,683
I want you to be a part of it.

811
00:53:42,081 --> 00:53:44,681
You're about to make a whole lot
of people around here real happy,

812
00:53:44,706 --> 00:53:47,709
because that little stunt
at the press conference,

813
00:53:47,761 --> 00:53:48,907
that was a doozy.

814
00:53:49,682 --> 00:53:52,335
This is not for the military.

815
00:53:52,337 --> 00:53:54,229
I'm not... It's different.

816
00:53:54,383 --> 00:53:57,010
What? You're a humanitarian
now or something?

817
00:53:57,052 --> 00:53:58,512
I need you to listen to me.
No.

818
00:53:58,553 --> 00:54:02,182
What you need is time
to get your mind right.

819
00:54:04,393 --> 00:54:05,977
I'm serious.
Ok.

820
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:10,201
It's nice seeing you, Tony.

821
00:54:11,143 --> 00:54:12,060
Thanks.

822
00:54:20,617 --> 00:54:22,011
Jarvis, you up?

823
00:54:22,411 --> 00:54:23,964
<i>For you sir, always.</i>

824
00:54:24,287 --> 00:54:25,992
I'd like to open a new project file,

825
00:54:25,994 --> 00:54:27,708
index as Mark Two.

826
00:54:29,376 --> 00:54:32,475
<i>Shall I store this on the Stark
Industries Central Database?</i>

827
00:54:33,338 --> 00:54:35,296
Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.

828
00:54:35,799 --> 00:54:38,388
Till further notice, why don't we just
keep everything on my private server?

829
00:54:38,676 --> 00:54:41,095
<i>Working on a secret
project, are we, sir?</i>

830
00:54:45,392 --> 00:54:47,325
I don't want this winding
up in the wrong hands.

831
00:54:50,605 --> 00:54:52,524
Maybe in mine, it can
actually do some good.

832
00:55:36,359 --> 00:55:37,130
Next.

833
00:55:38,283 --> 00:55:39,143
Up.

834
00:55:39,738 --> 00:55:42,248
Not in the boot, Dummy.
Right here. You got me?

835
00:55:42,699 --> 00:55:43,549
Stay put.

836
00:55:43,902 --> 00:55:44,648
Nice.

837
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:49,678
You're of no benefit at all.
Move down to the toe. I got this.

838
00:55:50,916 --> 00:55:52,709
Ok, I'm sorry, am I in your way?

839
00:55:59,966 --> 00:56:00,705
Up.

840
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:03,205
Screw it. Don't even move.

841
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:04,640
You...

842
00:56:05,853 --> 00:56:07,239
are a tragedy.

843
00:56:16,826 --> 00:56:19,006
<i>Ok, let's do this right.</i>

844
00:56:20,112 --> 00:56:22,210
<i>Start mark, half a meter,
and back and center.</i>

845
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,911
<i>Dummy, look alive.
You're on standby for fire safety.</i>

846
00:56:27,962 --> 00:56:29,047
You, roll it.

847
00:56:31,748 --> 00:56:32,415
<i>Ok.</i>

848
00:56:34,063 --> 00:56:35,360
<i>Activate hand controls.</i>

849
00:56:39,631 --> 00:56:40,815
<i>We're gonna start off nice and easy.</i>

850
00:56:40,817 --> 00:56:43,570
<i>We're gonna see if 10% thrust
capacity achieves lift.</i>

851
00:56:44,094 --> 00:56:45,166
<i>And three,</i>

852
00:56:46,304 --> 00:56:46,962
<i>two,</i>

853
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:48,758
<i>one.</i>

854
00:57:26,386 --> 00:57:28,427
Up two. Alright, set that.

855
00:57:28,764 --> 00:57:30,975
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

856
00:57:31,141 --> 00:57:32,899
Yeah, everything's... What?

857
00:57:33,185 --> 00:57:34,492
Obadiah's upstairs.
Great!

858
00:57:34,494 --> 00:57:35,659
What would you like me to tell him?
Great. I'll be right up.

859
00:57:36,938 --> 00:57:37,508
Ok.

860
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,692
I thought you said you
were done making weapons.

861
00:57:40,776 --> 00:57:41,477
It is.

862
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:45,484
This is a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.

863
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:51,109
I didn't expect that.

864
00:57:56,458 --> 00:57:57,245
How'd it go?

865
00:58:00,128 --> 00:58:01,433
It went that bad?

866
00:58:01,838 --> 00:58:04,591
Just because I brought
pizza back from New York

867
00:58:04,633 --> 00:58:06,011
doesn't mean it went bad.

868
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,250
Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

869
00:58:08,496 --> 00:58:10,220
It would have gone better
if you were there.

870
00:58:11,765 --> 00:58:13,308
You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.

871
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:15,562
I lay low and you take care of all...
Hey, come on.

872
00:58:15,727 --> 00:58:17,774
In public. The press.

873
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:20,995
This was a board of directors meeting.
This was...

874
00:58:21,566 --> 00:58:23,072
This was a board of directors meeting?

875
00:58:24,194 --> 00:58:26,764
The board is claiming you
have posttraumatic stress.

876
00:58:26,766 --> 00:58:27,898
They're filing an injunction.

877
00:58:27,948 --> 00:58:28,573
A what?

878
00:58:28,575 --> 00:58:29,992
They want to lock you out.

879
00:58:30,075 --> 00:58:31,366
Why, because the stocks
dipped 40 points?

880
00:58:31,368 --> 00:58:32,450
We knew that was gonna happen.

881
00:58:32,452 --> 00:58:34,619
Fifty-six and a half.
It doesn't matter.

882
00:58:34,621 --> 00:58:36,623
We own the controlling
interest in the company.

883
00:58:36,868 --> 00:58:39,627
Tony, the board has rights, too.

884
00:58:40,544 --> 00:58:41,990
They're making the case,

885
00:58:42,251 --> 00:58:44,504
that you and your new direction

886
00:58:44,506 --> 00:58:46,794
isn't in the company's best interest.
I'm being responsible!

887
00:58:46,796 --> 00:58:48,059
That's a new direction,

888
00:58:48,061 --> 00:58:49,432
for me, for the company.

889
00:58:50,762 --> 00:58:53,896
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...

890
00:58:54,725 --> 00:58:55,546
This is great.

891
00:58:56,288 --> 00:58:58,693
Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
I'll be in the shop.

892
00:58:59,354 --> 00:59:01,350
Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.

893
00:59:01,648 --> 00:59:05,068
I'm trying to turn this thing around,
but you got to give me something.

894
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:06,107
Something to pitch them.

895
00:59:06,769 --> 00:59:09,023
Let me have the engineers analyze that.

896
00:59:09,198 --> 00:59:10,363
You know, draw up some specs.

897
00:59:10,365 --> 00:59:12,591
No. No, absolutely not.
It'll give me a bone to throw the boys

898
00:59:12,617 --> 00:59:14,202
This one stays with me.
In New York!

899
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:15,452
That's it, Obie. Forget it.

900
00:59:15,454 --> 00:59:17,065
Alright, well, this stays with me, then.

901
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:18,687
Go on, here, you can have a piece.

902
00:59:19,038 --> 00:59:20,151
Take two.
Thank you.

903
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:22,476
You mind if I come down there
and see what you're doing?

904
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,258
Good night, Obie.

905
00:59:24,921 --> 00:59:28,149
Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0.

906
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,789
For lack of a better option,

907
00:59:29,801 --> 00:59:32,512
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,

908
00:59:32,554 --> 00:59:35,065
and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.

909
00:59:35,474 --> 00:59:36,504
<i>Alright, nice and easy.</i>

910
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:38,352
<i>Seriously,</i>

911
00:59:38,569 --> 00:59:39,848
<i>just gonna start off</i>

912
00:59:40,162 --> 00:59:42,024
<i>with 1% thrust capacity.</i>

913
00:59:43,793 --> 00:59:45,621
<i>And three, two, one.</i>

914
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:58,286
Ok.

915
01:00:00,312 --> 01:00:01,767
Please don't follow me
around with it either,

916
01:00:01,792 --> 01:00:04,211
because I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.

917
01:00:04,252 --> 01:00:06,044
Just stand down!
If something happens, then come in.

918
01:00:06,046 --> 01:00:07,893
And again, let's bring it up to 2.5.

919
01:00:08,382 --> 01:00:10,122
Three, two, one.

920
01:00:26,608 --> 01:00:28,258
Ok, this is where I don't want to be!

921
01:00:29,277 --> 01:00:30,612
Oh, not the car, not the car!

922
01:00:31,947 --> 01:00:32,947
Table!

923
01:00:44,305 --> 01:00:45,782
Could be worse! Could be worse!
We're fine!

924
01:00:47,813 --> 01:00:48,504
Ok.

925
01:01:06,314 --> 01:01:06,803
No!!

926
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,458
Yeah, I can fly.

927
01:01:16,283 --> 01:01:17,280
<i>Jarvis, are you there?</i>

928
01:01:17,282 --> 01:01:18,732
<i>At your service, sir.</i>

929
01:01:19,327 --> 01:01:20,412
Engage Heads Up Display.

930
01:01:20,659 --> 01:01:21,527
<i>Check.</i>

931
01:01:21,621 --> 01:01:23,582
Import all preferences
from home interface.

932
01:01:23,665 --> 01:01:24,577
<i>Will do, sir.</i>

933
01:01:32,174 --> 01:01:33,361
Alright, what do you say?

934
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:35,101
<i>I have indeed been uploaded, sir.</i>

935
01:01:35,322 --> 01:01:36,556
We're online and ready.

936
01:01:36,845 --> 01:01:38,348
Can we start the virtual walk-around?

937
01:01:38,582 --> 01:01:41,502
<i>Importing preferences and
calibrating virtual environment.</i>

938
01:01:41,641 --> 01:01:43,047
Do a check on control surfaces.

939
01:01:43,049 --> 01:01:44,297
<i>As you wish.</i>

940
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,116
<i>Test complete. Preparing to power
down and begin diagnostics.</i>

941
01:02:09,733 --> 01:02:12,047
Yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

942
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:13,632
Start listening in on ground control.

943
01:02:13,634 --> 01:02:15,016
<i>Sir, there are still terabytes</i>

944
01:02:15,018 --> 01:02:17,546
<i>of calculations needed before
an actual flight is...</i>

945
01:02:17,552 --> 01:02:18,453
Jarvis!

946
01:02:18,728 --> 01:02:21,390
Sometimes you got to run
before you can walk.

947
01:02:21,556 --> 01:02:22,145
Ready?

948
01:02:22,147 --> 01:02:25,603
In three, two, one.

949
01:02:49,126 --> 01:02:50,281
Handles like a dream.

950
01:03:18,996 --> 01:03:20,576
Alright, let's see what this thing can do.

951
01:03:20,724 --> 01:03:22,170
What's SR-71's record?

952
01:03:22,293 --> 01:03:25,743
<i>The altitude record for fixed
wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.</i>

953
01:03:26,455 --> 01:03:28,300
Records are made to be broken!
Come on!

954
01:03:32,294 --> 01:03:35,157
<i>Sir, there is a potentially
fatal buildup of ice occurring.</i>

955
01:03:35,964 --> 01:03:36,964
Keep going!

956
01:03:39,342 --> 01:03:40,398
Higher!

957
01:03:54,316 --> 01:03:56,507
We iced up, Jarvis! Deploy flaps!

958
01:03:57,735 --> 01:03:58,710
Jarvis!

959
01:04:01,323 --> 01:04:02,975
Come on, we got to break the ice!

960
01:04:38,953 --> 01:04:39,728
Kill power.

961
01:06:04,529 --> 01:06:07,949
Notes. Main transducer feels
sluggish at plus 40 altitude.

962
01:06:07,991 --> 01:06:09,826
Hull pressurization is problematic.

963
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,342
I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.

964
01:06:12,454 --> 01:06:14,439
<i>A very astute observation, sir.</i>

965
01:06:14,688 --> 01:06:16,559
<i>Perhaps, if you intend
to visit other planets,</i>

966
01:06:16,561 --> 01:06:18,087
<i>we should improve the exosystems.</i>

967
01:06:18,168 --> 01:06:20,750
Connect to the sys. Co.
Have it reconfigure the shell metals.

968
01:06:20,837 --> 01:06:23,965
Use the gold titanium alloy from
the seraphim tactical satellite.

969
01:06:24,007 --> 01:06:25,882
That should ensure a fuselage integrity

970
01:06:25,884 --> 01:06:27,967
while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.

971
01:06:27,969 --> 01:06:29,165
<i>Got it?
Yes.</i>

972
01:06:29,304 --> 01:06:31,598
<i>Shall I render using
proposed specifications?</i>

973
01:06:31,691 --> 01:06:32,466
Thrill me.

974
01:06:34,476 --> 01:06:36,645
<i>Tonight's red-hot red carpet</i>

975
01:06:36,686 --> 01:06:39,022
<i>is right here at the Disney Concert Hall,</i>

976
01:06:39,106 --> 01:06:41,400
<i>where Tony Stark's third annual benefit</i>

977
01:06:41,483 --> 01:06:43,360
<i>for the Firefighter's Family Fund</i>

978
01:06:43,388 --> 01:06:45,066
<i>has become the place to be</i>

979
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:46,391
<i>for L.A.'s high society.</i>
Jarvis, we get an invite for that?

980
01:06:46,446 --> 01:06:48,753
<i>I have no record of an invitation, sir.</i>

981
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:50,490
<i>Hasn't been seen in public</i>

982
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:54,024
<i>since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.</i>

983
01:06:54,496 --> 01:06:57,165
<i>Some claim he's suffering
from posttraumatic stress</i>

984
01:06:57,207 --> 01:06:59,230
<i>and has been bedridden for weeks.</i>

985
01:06:59,392 --> 01:07:01,112
<i>Whatever the case may be,</i>

986
01:07:01,336 --> 01:07:04,172
<i>no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.</i>

987
01:07:04,174 --> 01:07:06,343
<i>The render is complete.</i>

988
01:07:06,372 --> 01:07:07,831
A little ostentatious, don't you think?

989
01:07:08,085 --> 01:07:10,557
<i>What was I thinking?
You're usually so discreet.</i>

990
01:07:12,845 --> 01:07:13,631
Tell you what.

991
01:07:13,995 --> 01:07:15,459
Throw a little hot-rod red in there.

992
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:17,730
<i>Yes, that should help
you keep a low profile.</i>

993
01:07:21,549 --> 01:07:23,183
<i>The render is complete.</i>

994
01:07:24,025 --> 01:07:25,665
Hey, I like it. Fabricate it.
Paint it.

995
01:07:26,027 --> 01:07:27,612
<i>Commencing automated assembly.</i>

996
01:07:27,696 --> 01:07:30,669
<i>Estimated completiontime
is five hours.</i>

997
01:07:30,949 --> 01:07:32,070
Don't wait up for me, honey.

998
01:07:56,224 --> 01:08:00,020
Weapons manufacturing is only one
small part of what Stark Industries

999
01:08:00,062 --> 01:08:01,855
is all about, and our partnership.

1000
01:08:01,897 --> 01:08:04,138
With the fire and rescue community...

1001
01:08:06,568 --> 01:08:08,236
Hey, Tony, remember me?

1002
01:08:08,238 --> 01:08:08,948
Sure don't.

1003
01:08:10,572 --> 01:08:11,572
You look great, Hef.

1004
01:08:13,909 --> 01:08:15,266
We're going to have a great quarter.

1005
01:08:15,268 --> 01:08:17,744
What's the world coming to when
a guy's got to crash his own party?

1006
01:08:19,164 --> 01:08:20,462
Look at you.

1007
01:08:21,813 --> 01:08:23,336
Hey, what a surprise.

1008
01:08:23,338 --> 01:08:24,239
I'll see you inside.

1009
01:08:25,953 --> 01:08:26,476
Hey.

1010
01:08:26,812 --> 01:08:29,114
Listen, take it slow, alright?

1011
01:08:29,116 --> 01:08:30,842
I think I got the board
right where we want them.

1012
01:08:30,844 --> 01:08:33,145
You got it. Just cabin fever.
I'll just be a minute.

1013
01:08:39,017 --> 01:08:40,519
Give me a Scotch.
I'm starving.

1014
01:08:41,681 --> 01:08:42,602
Mr. Stark?

1015
01:08:43,271 --> 01:08:45,215
Yeah?
Agent Coulson.

1016
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:47,257
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the...

1017
01:08:47,818 --> 01:08:51,037
Strategic Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and Logistics Division.

1018
01:08:51,238 --> 01:08:52,771
God, you need a new name for that.

1019
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:54,184
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

1020
01:08:55,623 --> 01:08:57,785
Listen, I know this must be
a trying time for you but,

1021
01:08:57,868 --> 01:08:59,246
we need to debrief you.

1022
01:08:59,579 --> 01:09:01,210
There's still a lot of
unanswered questions,

1023
01:09:01,212 --> 01:09:02,994
and time can be a factor
with these things.

1024
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:05,154
Let's just put something on the books.

1025
01:09:05,668 --> 01:09:08,737
How about the 24th at 7:00 P.M.
at Stark Industries?

1026
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:10,263
Tell you what.

1027
01:09:10,593 --> 01:09:12,425
You got it. You're absolutely right.

1028
01:09:12,874 --> 01:09:13,672
Well,

1029
01:09:14,114 --> 01:09:17,101
I'm going to go to my assistant,
and we'll make a date.

1030
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,767
You look fantastic!
I didn't recognize you.

1031
01:09:20,769 --> 01:09:23,184
What are you doing here?
Just avoiding government agents.

1032
01:09:23,186 --> 01:09:24,980
Are you by yourself?
Yes. Where'd you get that dress?

1033
01:09:25,449 --> 01:09:26,864
Oh, it was a birthday present.
That's great.

1034
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,123
From you, actually.
Well, I got great taste.

1035
01:09:29,151 --> 01:09:29,929
Yes.

1036
01:09:30,485 --> 01:09:32,404
You want to dance?
Oh, no.

1037
01:09:32,409 --> 01:09:33,838
Alright, come on.
Thank you. No.

1038
01:09:45,299 --> 01:09:46,787
Am I making you uncomfortable?

1039
01:09:48,045 --> 01:09:49,115
No. No.

1040
01:09:49,804 --> 01:09:53,381
I always forget to wear deodorant
and dance with my boss

1041
01:09:53,383 --> 01:09:56,565
in front of everyone that I work
with in a dress with no back.

1042
01:09:57,512 --> 01:09:58,689
You look great and you smell great.

1043
01:09:58,722 --> 01:09:59,946
Oh, God.

1044
01:10:00,048 --> 01:10:01,959
But I could fire you if that
would take the edge off.

1045
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:05,396
I actually don't think that you
could tie your shoes without me.

1046
01:10:05,812 --> 01:10:07,186
I'd make it a week. Sure.
Really?

1047
01:10:07,188 --> 01:10:08,791
What's your Social Security number?

1048
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,030
Five.
Five?

1049
01:10:15,906 --> 01:10:17,199
Right.
Right.

1050
01:10:17,282 --> 01:10:19,761
You're missing just a couple of digits there.

1051
01:10:19,763 --> 01:10:20,573
The other eight?
Yes.

1052
01:10:21,816 --> 01:10:23,312
So I got you for the other eight.

1053
01:10:35,509 --> 01:10:37,677
How about a little air?
Yes, I need some air.

1054
01:10:40,472 --> 01:10:42,472
That was totally weird.
Totally harmless.

1055
01:10:42,474 --> 01:10:45,162
It was totally not harmless, by the way.

1056
01:10:45,519 --> 01:10:47,021
We're dancing. No one's even watching.
Everybody

1057
01:10:47,023 --> 01:10:48,855
who I work with...
No, you know why?

1058
01:10:48,857 --> 01:10:49,920
I think you lost objectivity.

1059
01:10:49,922 --> 01:10:50,438
I think they just...

1060
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:51,902
People... We just danced.
I don't know...

1061
01:10:52,022 --> 01:10:53,429
No, it was not just a dance.

1062
01:10:53,431 --> 01:10:55,349
You don't understand
because you're you.

1063
01:10:55,445 --> 01:10:58,346
And everybody knows
exactly who you are

1064
01:10:58,365 --> 01:11:01,618
and how you are with girls and all
of that, which is completely fine.

1065
01:11:01,701 --> 01:11:04,576
But, you know then me,
you're my boss and I'm,

1066
01:11:04,578 --> 01:11:05,813
Please I don't think, I
dancing with you because

1067
01:11:05,815 --> 01:11:07,307
really don't think it was taken that way.
It makes me look like...

1068
01:11:07,455 --> 01:11:08,997
the one who's trying to...

1069
01:11:09,209 --> 01:11:11,086
I just think you're overstating it.
You know and we're here,

1070
01:11:11,169 --> 01:11:12,165
and then I'm...

1071
01:11:13,403 --> 01:11:14,738
wearing this ridiculous...

1072
01:11:15,048 --> 01:11:17,545
dress and then we were
dancing like that and...

1073
01:11:31,773 --> 01:11:33,941
I would like a drink, please.
Got it, ok.

1074
01:11:36,027 --> 01:11:38,286
I would like a vodka Martini, please.

1075
01:11:38,288 --> 01:11:38,948
Ok.

1076
01:11:38,991 --> 01:11:43,721
Very dry with olives, a lot of olives.
Like, at least three olives.

1077
01:11:44,578 --> 01:11:47,622
Two vodka Martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.

1078
01:11:47,706 --> 01:11:49,019
Make one of them dirty, will you?

1079
01:11:55,942 --> 01:11:57,238
Tony Stark.

1080
01:11:57,466 --> 01:11:59,509
Oh, hey.
Fancy seeing you here.

1081
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:04,852
Carrie.
Christine.

1082
01:12:04,926 --> 01:12:05,860
That's right.

1083
01:12:06,047 --> 01:12:08,031
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

1084
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:10,228
Can I at least get a reaction from you?

1085
01:12:10,233 --> 01:12:11,134
Panic.

1086
01:12:11,136 --> 01:12:12,759
I would say panic is my reaction.

1087
01:12:12,766 --> 01:12:14,272
Because I was referring
to your company's

1088
01:12:14,274 --> 01:12:15,674
involvement in this latest atrocity.

1089
01:12:15,692 --> 01:12:17,102
Yeah. They just put my
name on the invitation.

1090
01:12:17,165 --> 01:12:18,236
I don't know what to tell you.

1091
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,655
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

1092
01:12:20,699 --> 01:12:22,530
I was out of town for a couple months,

1093
01:12:22,532 --> 01:12:24,730
in case you didn't hear.
Is this what you call accountability?

1094
01:12:25,619 --> 01:12:26,666
It's a town called Gulmira.

1095
01:12:27,207 --> 01:12:28,031
Heard of it?

1096
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:41,023
When were these taken?

1097
01:12:41,176 --> 01:12:42,252
Yesterday.

1098
01:12:42,803 --> 01:12:44,846
I didn't approve any shipment.
Well, your company did.

1099
01:12:44,888 --> 01:12:46,382
Well, I'm not my company.

1100
01:12:47,974 --> 01:12:49,184
Please, do you mind?

1101
01:12:49,186 --> 01:12:50,405
Have you seen these pictures?

1102
01:12:51,269 --> 01:12:52,646
What's going on in Gulmira?
Tony, Tony.

1103
01:12:52,687 --> 01:12:54,231
You can't afford to be this naive.

1104
01:12:54,233 --> 01:12:55,943
You know what?
I was naive before,

1105
01:12:56,068 --> 01:12:57,829
when they said, here's the line.
We don't cross it.

1106
01:12:57,859 --> 01:12:59,357
This is how we do business.

1107
01:12:59,528 --> 01:13:01,440
If we're double-dealing under the table.

1108
01:13:01,798 --> 01:13:02,571
Are we?

1109
01:13:03,041 --> 01:13:04,113
Tony, your picture, please!

1110
01:13:07,577 --> 01:13:08,925
Let's take a picture. Come on.

1111
01:13:09,958 --> 01:13:11,299
Picture time!

1112
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,194
Tony Stark! Sir!

1113
01:13:14,251 --> 01:13:15,993
Who do you think locked you out?

1114
01:13:16,545 --> 01:13:19,379
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.

1115
01:13:22,216 --> 01:13:23,965
It was the only way I could protect you.

1116
01:13:27,055 --> 01:13:28,306
No. No.

1117
01:13:36,773 --> 01:13:40,986
<i>The 15-mile hike to the outskirts
of Gulmira can only be described</i>

1118
01:13:40,988 --> 01:13:42,488
<i>as a descent into hell,</i>

1119
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:44,784
<i>into a modern day Heart of Darkness.</i>

1120
01:13:45,031 --> 01:13:47,951
<i>Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages</i>

1121
01:13:48,034 --> 01:13:49,745
<i>have been driven from their homes,</i>

1122
01:13:49,828 --> 01:13:51,913
<i>displaced from their lands
by warlords,</i>

1123
01:13:51,997 --> 01:13:53,928
<i>emboldened by a new found power.</i>

1124
01:13:54,416 --> 01:13:56,492
<i>Villagers have been forced
to take shelter,</i>

1125
01:13:56,494 --> 01:13:58,404
<i>in whatever crude dwellings
they can find,</i>

1126
01:13:58,406 --> 01:14:00,256
<i>in the ruins of other villages,</i>

1127
01:14:00,338 --> 01:14:03,841
<i>or here in the remnants of an
old Soviet smelting plant.</i>

1128
01:14:09,056 --> 01:14:12,434
<i>Recent violence has been attributed
to a group of foreign fighters</i>

1129
01:14:12,517 --> 01:14:15,173
<i>referred to by locals
as the Ten Rings.</i>

1130
01:14:15,479 --> 01:14:18,857
<i>As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.</i>

1131
01:14:18,869 --> 01:14:22,274
<i>A mission that could prove fatal
to anyone who stands in their way.</i>

1132
01:14:23,278 --> 01:14:25,758
<i>With no political will or
international pressure,</i>

1133
01:14:25,796 --> 01:14:28,148
<i>there is very little hope
for these refugees.</i>

1134
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:31,703
<i>Around me, a woman begging
for news on her husband,</i>

1135
01:14:31,787 --> 01:14:33,580
<i>who was kidnapped by insurgents,</i>

1136
01:14:33,622 --> 01:14:35,319
<i>either forced to join their militia...</i>

1137
01:14:37,209 --> 01:14:39,836
<i>Desperate refugees clutch
yellowed photographs,</i>

1138
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,506
<i>holding them up
to anyone who will stop.</i>

1139
01:14:42,589 --> 01:14:44,257
<i>A child's simple question,</i>

1140
01:14:44,259 --> 01:14:46,142
<i>Where are my mother and father?</i>

1141
01:14:47,803 --> 01:14:50,081
<i>There's very little hope
for these refugees,</i>

1142
01:14:50,305 --> 01:14:54,028
<i>refugees who can only wonder,
who if anyone, will help.</i>

1143
01:16:27,191 --> 01:16:29,700
Hurry it up.
Put the women in the trucks.

1144
01:16:29,777 --> 01:16:30,819
Stack the weapons here.

1145
01:16:30,903 --> 01:16:31,945
Clear all the houses.

1146
01:16:32,029 --> 01:16:33,697
That one there.
Faster. Faster.

1147
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:43,473
Grab that dog.

1148
01:16:46,456 --> 01:16:47,823
Put him with the others.

1149
01:16:53,026 --> 01:16:55,505
Papa! Papa!

1150
01:16:58,723 --> 01:17:00,415
What the hell is this?

1151
01:17:11,736 --> 01:17:13,109
Shoot this dog.

1152
01:17:13,779 --> 01:17:15,253
You're all incompetent.

1153
01:17:17,185 --> 01:17:18,173
Papa!

1154
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:19,594
Turn your head!

1155
01:17:19,595 --> 01:17:20,125
Papa!

1156
01:17:20,126 --> 01:17:21,023
Turn your head!

1157
01:17:21,371 --> 01:17:22,541
Papa!

1158
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:02,449
Papa!

1159
01:18:02,685 --> 01:18:03,793
Papa!

1160
01:18:26,347 --> 01:18:27,592
<i>He's all yours.</i>

1161
01:19:26,731 --> 01:19:28,892
What the hell was that?
Were we cleared to go in there?

1162
01:19:28,917 --> 01:19:31,211
No, they were using human shields.
We never got the green light.

1163
01:19:31,253 --> 01:19:33,211
Put me through to State.
They're going to be all over this.

1164
01:19:33,213 --> 01:19:34,211
Get those monitors up!

1165
01:19:34,743 --> 01:19:35,951
We got a bogey!

1166
01:19:36,169 --> 01:19:38,401
Wasn't Air Force!
We got the CIA on the line?

1167
01:19:38,427 --> 01:19:40,429
I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.

1168
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:42,139
No, it definitely is not us, sir!

1169
01:19:42,222 --> 01:19:43,932
It wasn't Navy.
Wasn't Marines.

1170
01:19:43,974 --> 01:19:46,513
I need answers!
Can I please get eyes on target?

1171
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,854
Negative, negative.
Cannot identify.

1172
01:19:48,937 --> 01:19:51,337
Get me Colonel Rhodes from Weapons
Development down here now!

1173
01:19:58,363 --> 01:20:00,115
We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced

1174
01:20:00,143 --> 01:20:01,895
with all known databases.
We have nothing.

1175
01:20:01,992 --> 01:20:04,202
Any high altitude
surveillance in the region?

1176
01:20:04,221 --> 01:20:05,981
We got an AWAC
and a Global Hawk in the area.

1177
01:20:05,983 --> 01:20:07,787
So this thing just
appeared out of nowhere?

1178
01:20:07,789 --> 01:20:09,166
How come it didn't
show up on the radar?

1179
01:20:09,249 --> 01:20:11,251
Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.

1180
01:20:11,293 --> 01:20:13,545
Is it stealth?
No, sir, it's tiny.

1181
01:20:13,573 --> 01:20:15,404
We think it's an unmanned aerial vehicle.

1182
01:20:15,951 --> 01:20:17,577
Colonel, what are we dealing with here?

1183
01:20:20,398 --> 01:20:22,557
Let me make a call.
Sergeant, clear a hole.

1184
01:20:26,892 --> 01:20:27,693
Hello?

1185
01:20:28,075 --> 01:20:28,728
Tony?

1186
01:20:28,810 --> 01:20:29,598
<i>Who's this?</i>

1187
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:30,533
It's Rhodes.

1188
01:20:30,812 --> 01:20:32,856
Sorry, hello?
<i>I said it's Rhodes.</i>

1189
01:20:32,939 --> 01:20:35,340
Speak up, please.
What in the hell is that noise?

1190
01:20:35,901 --> 01:20:37,327
Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.

1191
01:20:37,652 --> 01:20:39,321
Yeah well, I need your help right now.

1192
01:20:39,365 --> 01:20:40,541
<i>It's funny how that works?</i>

1193
01:20:40,815 --> 01:20:43,293
Yeah. Speaking of funny,
we've got a weapons depot,

1194
01:20:43,445 --> 01:20:46,076
that was just blown up a few clicks from
where you were being held captive.

1195
01:20:46,078 --> 01:20:47,829
<i>Well, that's say, that's a hot spot.</i>

1196
01:20:47,871 --> 01:20:50,332
<i>Sounds like someone stepped in
and did your job for you?</i>

1197
01:20:50,335 --> 01:20:51,775
Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?
<i>I'm not!</i>

1198
01:20:51,777 --> 01:20:52,893
<i>I was just jogging in the canyon.</i>

1199
01:20:52,895 --> 01:20:54,700
I thought you were driving.
<i>Right, I was driving</i>

1200
01:20:54,711 --> 01:20:56,505
<i>to the canyon,
where I'm going to jog.</i>

1201
01:20:56,507 --> 01:20:58,983
You sure you don't have any tech
in that area I should know about?

1202
01:20:59,007 --> 01:21:00,509
<i>Nope! Bogey spotted!</i>

1203
01:21:00,592 --> 01:21:01,843
Whiplash, come in hot.

1204
01:21:01,927 --> 01:21:03,902
Ok good, because I'm staring
at one right now,

1205
01:21:03,904 --> 01:21:05,787
and it's about to be blown
to kingdom come.

1206
01:21:07,508 --> 01:21:08,636
That's my exit.

1207
01:21:14,022 --> 01:21:16,855
<i>Ballroom, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sights.</i>

1208
01:21:17,692 --> 01:21:19,077
Whiplash One, what is it?

1209
01:21:19,194 --> 01:21:20,529
<i>I've got no idea.</i>

1210
01:21:20,612 --> 01:21:21,655
You have radio contact?

1211
01:21:21,696 --> 01:21:22,989
<i>Non responsive, sir.</i>

1212
01:21:23,031 --> 01:21:24,319
Then you are clear to engage.

1213
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:26,996
<i>Hit it.</i>

1214
01:21:31,998 --> 01:21:33,346
<i>That bogey just went supersonic.</i>

1215
01:21:33,348 --> 01:21:34,350
<i>I got a lock!</i>

1216
01:21:38,950 --> 01:21:39,859
<i>Inbound missile.</i>

1217
01:21:40,376 --> 01:21:41,244
<i>Flares!</i>

1218
01:21:44,010 --> 01:21:45,946
<i>Wait a second.
Bogey deployed flares!</i>

1219
01:22:00,902 --> 01:22:01,878
Deploy flaps!

1220
01:22:03,405 --> 01:22:04,232
Holy!

1221
01:22:04,698 --> 01:22:06,219
That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.

1222
01:22:06,249 --> 01:22:07,725
The sat visual has been lost.

1223
01:22:07,993 --> 01:22:09,703
<i>No way that's a UAV.</i>

1224
01:22:09,745 --> 01:22:10,594
What is it?

1225
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:11,923
I can't see anything.

1226
01:22:12,622 --> 01:22:14,557
<i>Whatever it was,
it just bought the farm.</i>

1227
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:17,073
<i>I think bogey's been handled, sir.</i>

1228
01:22:27,554 --> 01:22:29,264
Hello?
<i>Hi, Rhodey, it's me.</i>

1229
01:22:29,306 --> 01:22:31,067
It's who?
<i>I'm sorry, it is me.</i>

1230
01:22:31,099 --> 01:22:32,392
<i>You asked. What you were
asking about is me.</i>

1231
01:22:32,434 --> 01:22:33,935
No, see, this isn't a game.

1232
01:22:34,019 --> 01:22:37,408
You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.

1233
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:39,357
You understand that?
This is not a piece of equipment.

1234
01:22:39,441 --> 01:22:41,809
I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!

1235
01:22:42,232 --> 01:22:43,785
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

1236
01:22:45,906 --> 01:22:47,532
<i>Mark your position and return to base.</i>

1237
01:22:47,534 --> 01:22:48,910
<i>Roger that, Ballroom.</i>

1238
01:22:51,343 --> 01:22:52,511
<i>On your belly!</i>

1239
01:22:52,594 --> 01:22:53,418
<i>It looks like a...</i>

1240
01:22:53,813 --> 01:22:54,606
<i>man!</i>

1241
01:22:54,790 --> 01:22:57,149
<i>Shake him off!
Roll! Roll!</i>

1242
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:06,776
<i>I'm hit! I'm hit!</i>

1243
01:23:07,153 --> 01:23:09,196
It's confirmed.
He has been hit.

1244
01:23:13,266 --> 01:23:14,603
<i>Punch out!
Punch out!</i>

1245
01:23:21,483 --> 01:23:23,308
<i>Whiplash One down.</i>

1246
01:23:23,383 --> 01:23:25,092
Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?

1247
01:23:25,112 --> 01:23:27,197
<i>Negative!
No chute, no chute!</i>

1248
01:23:32,869 --> 01:23:34,160
<i>My chute's jammed!</i>

1249
01:23:40,293 --> 01:23:42,289
<i>Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.</i>

1250
01:23:42,713 --> 01:23:43,943
Whiplash Two, reengage.

1251
01:23:43,945 --> 01:23:45,322
If you get a clear shot, you take it.

1252
01:23:47,858 --> 01:23:49,778
Major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.

1253
01:23:49,803 --> 01:23:51,923
Call off the Raptors.
That thing just took out an F-22

1254
01:23:51,925 --> 01:23:53,246
inside a legal no fly zone!

1255
01:23:53,248 --> 01:23:55,584
Whiplash Two, if you have
a clear shot, take it!

1256
01:23:55,809 --> 01:23:58,118
<i>You've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.</i>

1257
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:59,277
Keep going!

1258
01:24:07,279 --> 01:24:09,030
<i>Good chute!
Good chute!</i>

1259
01:24:16,913 --> 01:24:18,665
Tony, you still there?

1260
01:24:18,707 --> 01:24:19,791
<i>Hey, thanks.</i>

1261
01:24:19,875 --> 01:24:22,020
Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.

1262
01:24:23,253 --> 01:24:24,854
You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?

1263
01:24:26,465 --> 01:24:28,517
Yeah, well technically he hit me, so...

1264
01:24:29,009 --> 01:24:30,552
<i>Now are you going to come by
and see what I'm working on?</i>

1265
01:24:30,554 --> 01:24:33,175
No, no, no, no, no, no,
the less I know, the better.

1266
01:24:33,599 --> 01:24:35,333
Now what am I supposed
to tell the press?

1267
01:24:35,347 --> 01:24:37,891
<i>Training exercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?</i>

1268
01:24:37,893 --> 01:24:39,089
It's not that simple.

1269
01:24:40,437 --> 01:24:42,353
An unfortunate training exercise

1270
01:24:42,355 --> 01:24:45,242
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.

1271
01:24:45,984 --> 01:24:48,875
I am pleased to report that
the pilot was not injured.

1272
01:24:49,446 --> 01:24:52,935
<i>As for the unexpected turn of
events on the ground in Gulmira,</i>

1273
01:24:53,450 --> 01:24:56,711
<i>it is still unclear who
or what intervened,</i>

1274
01:24:57,079 --> 01:25:00,863
<i>but I can assure you that the United
States government was not involved.</i>

1275
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:04,021
Hey!

1276
01:25:06,254 --> 01:25:07,808
<i>It is a tight fit, sir.</i>

1277
01:25:09,132 --> 01:25:11,676
<i>Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.</i>

1278
01:25:12,094 --> 01:25:13,704
Be gentle.
This is my first time.

1279
01:25:14,930 --> 01:25:16,390
I designed this to come off, so...

1280
01:25:17,032 --> 01:25:17,618
Hey.

1281
01:25:19,017 --> 01:25:20,192
I really should be able to...

1282
01:25:21,395 --> 01:25:22,755
<i>Please, try not to move, sir.</i>

1283
01:25:24,314 --> 01:25:25,518
What's going on here?

1284
01:25:31,154 --> 01:25:33,593
Let's face it. This is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.

1285
01:25:35,751 --> 01:25:37,251
Are those bullet holes?

1286
01:26:05,068 --> 01:26:06,069
Welcome.

1287
01:26:09,609 --> 01:26:11,608
Compliments of Tony Stark.

1288
01:26:12,779 --> 01:26:15,743
If you'd killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.

1289
01:26:16,491 --> 01:26:18,410
You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.

1290
01:26:18,660 --> 01:26:20,203
Show me the weapon.

1291
01:26:21,569 --> 01:26:22,424
Come.

1292
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:25,178
Leave your guards outside.

1293
01:26:41,933 --> 01:26:43,837
His escape bore unexpected fruit.

1294
01:26:47,105 --> 01:26:48,822
So this is how he did it.

1295
01:26:49,399 --> 01:26:50,959
This is only a first, crude effort.

1296
01:26:52,110 --> 01:26:54,192
Stark has perfected his design.

1297
01:26:54,863 --> 01:26:57,162
He has made a masterpiece of death.

1298
01:26:57,916 --> 01:27:00,669
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.

1299
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,547
And you dream of Stark's throne.

1300
01:27:06,952 --> 01:27:08,322
We have a common enemy.

1301
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:14,900
If we are still in business,

1302
01:27:18,011 --> 01:27:20,072
I will give you these designs

1303
01:27:21,723 --> 01:27:22,723
as a gift.

1304
01:27:24,291 --> 01:27:25,435
And in turn,

1305
01:27:27,382 --> 01:27:29,403
I hope you'll repay me...

1306
01:27:30,217 --> 01:27:32,688
with a gift of iron soldiers.

1307
01:27:43,534 --> 01:27:45,985
This is the only gift you shall receive.

1308
01:27:49,459 --> 01:27:50,836
Technology.

1309
01:27:52,713 --> 01:27:55,497
It's always been your Achilles'
heel in this part of the world.

1310
01:27:57,426 --> 01:27:58,600
Don't worry.

1311
01:27:58,602 --> 01:28:00,601
It'll only last for 15 minutes.

1312
01:28:01,805 --> 01:28:03,781
That's the least of your problems.

1313
01:28:09,563 --> 01:28:11,367
Crate up the armor and the rest of it.

1314
01:28:13,661 --> 01:28:15,538
Alright, let's finish up here.

1315
01:28:19,710 --> 01:28:22,611
Set up Sector 16 underneath
the arc reactor,

1316
01:28:22,826 --> 01:28:24,578
and I'm going to want this data masked.

1317
01:28:24,934 --> 01:28:26,411
Recruit our top engineers.

1318
01:28:26,413 --> 01:28:28,013
I want a prototype right away.

1319
01:28:36,347 --> 01:28:39,331
Hey. You busy?
You mind if I send you on an errand?

1320
01:28:39,718 --> 01:28:41,707
I need you to go to my office.

1321
01:28:42,424 --> 01:28:44,182
You're going to hack into the mainframe
and you're going to retrieve

1322
01:28:44,184 --> 01:28:46,711
all the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip.

1323
01:28:47,603 --> 01:28:48,683
This'll get you in.

1324
01:28:49,311 --> 01:28:50,937
It's probably under Executive Files.

1325
01:28:50,979 --> 01:28:51,644
If not,

1326
01:28:51,646 --> 01:28:52,810
they put it on a ghost drive,

1327
01:28:52,812 --> 01:28:55,246
in which case you need to look
for the lowest numeric heading.

1328
01:28:56,443 --> 01:28:58,951
And what do you plan to do with this
information if I bring it back here?

1329
01:28:58,953 --> 01:28:59,949
Same drill.

1330
01:29:00,052 --> 01:29:02,113
They've been dealing under the table,
and I'm going to stop them.

1331
01:29:02,115 --> 01:29:03,367
I'm going to find my weapons,

1332
01:29:03,916 --> 01:29:05,272
and destroy them.

1333
01:29:06,117 --> 01:29:07,036
Tony,

1334
01:29:09,593 --> 01:29:11,512
you know that I would
help you with anything,

1335
01:29:11,603 --> 01:29:12,347
but

1336
01:29:12,699 --> 01:29:15,608
I cannot help you if you're going
to start all of this again.

1337
01:29:15,649 --> 01:29:17,625
There is nothing except this.

1338
01:29:18,081 --> 01:29:19,451
There's no art opening.

1339
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,650
There is no benefit.
There is nothing...

1340
01:29:21,804 --> 01:29:22,922
to sign.

1341
01:29:23,757 --> 01:29:25,281
There is the next mission,

1342
01:29:26,009 --> 01:29:27,188
and nothing else.

1343
01:29:28,183 --> 01:29:29,183
Is that so?

1344
01:29:31,686 --> 01:29:32,826
Well, then I quit.

1345
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:37,967
You stood by my side all these years

1346
01:29:37,984 --> 01:29:40,332
while I reaped the benefits of destruction.

1347
01:29:41,050 --> 01:29:42,926
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people

1348
01:29:42,992 --> 01:29:44,827
that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?

1349
01:29:44,950 --> 01:29:46,665
You're going to kill yourself, Tony.

1350
01:29:47,536 --> 01:29:49,056
I'm not going to be a part of it.

1351
01:29:49,417 --> 01:29:50,613
I shouldn't be alive,

1352
01:29:52,728 --> 01:29:54,313
unless it was for a reason.

1353
01:29:55,752 --> 01:29:57,224
I'm not crazy, Pepper.

1354
01:29:58,083 --> 01:29:59,163
I just finally know...

1355
01:30:00,149 --> 01:30:01,528
what I have to do.

1356
01:30:05,595 --> 01:30:06,971
And I know in my heart,

1357
01:30:07,411 --> 01:30:08,537
that it's right.

1358
01:30:24,114 --> 01:30:25,629
You're all I have too you know.

1359
01:31:36,144 --> 01:31:37,418
Sector 16?

1360
01:31:38,997 --> 01:31:40,961
What are you up to, Obadiah?

1361
01:31:53,829 --> 01:31:58,062
<i>You did not tell us that the target you
paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark.</i>

1362
01:31:58,208 --> 01:31:59,793
<i>As you can see, Obadiah Stane,</i>
Oh, my God.

1363
01:31:59,835 --> 01:32:02,671
<i>Your deception and lies
will cost you dearly.</i>

1364
01:32:02,822 --> 01:32:05,533
<i>The price to kill Tony
Stark has just gone up.</i>

1365
01:32:09,428 --> 01:32:10,186
So,

1366
01:32:12,198 --> 01:32:13,739
what are we going to do about this?

1367
01:32:25,777 --> 01:32:26,669
I know,

1368
01:32:27,045 --> 01:32:29,142
what you're going through, Pepper.

1369
01:32:37,022 --> 01:32:37,855
Tony.

1370
01:32:38,208 --> 01:32:40,568
He always gets the good stuff,
doesn't he?

1371
01:33:02,064 --> 01:33:03,782
I was so happy...

1372
01:33:05,366 --> 01:33:06,640
when he came home.

1373
01:33:06,704 --> 01:33:09,406
It was like we got him
back from the dead.

1374
01:33:12,503 --> 01:33:14,061
Now I realize,

1375
01:33:16,745 --> 01:33:17,458
well,

1376
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:19,783
Tony never really did come home, did he?

1377
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:24,270
He left a part of himself in that cave.

1378
01:33:27,172 --> 01:33:28,637
Breaks my heart.

1379
01:33:31,093 --> 01:33:31,934
Well,

1380
01:33:33,242 --> 01:33:35,089
he's a complicated person.

1381
01:33:37,766 --> 01:33:41,077
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be alright.

1382
01:33:47,442 --> 01:33:50,217
You are a very rare woman.

1383
01:33:52,739 --> 01:33:54,783
Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.

1384
01:33:57,619 --> 01:33:59,366
Thank you. Thanks.

1385
01:34:01,623 --> 01:34:03,417
I'd better get back there.

1386
01:34:09,172 --> 01:34:10,841
Is that today's paper?

1387
01:34:12,843 --> 01:34:13,738
Yes.

1388
01:34:14,386 --> 01:34:15,621
Do you mind?

1389
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:17,669
Not at all.

1390
01:34:17,733 --> 01:34:18,578
Puzzle.

1391
01:34:18,598 --> 01:34:19,613
Of course.

1392
01:34:23,395 --> 01:34:24,395
Take care.

1393
01:34:48,837 --> 01:34:49,678
Ms. Potts?

1394
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:50,631
We had an appointment.

1395
01:34:50,726 --> 01:34:51,811
Did you forget about our appointment?

1396
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,341
Nope, right now. Come with me.

1397
01:34:53,425 --> 01:34:54,333
Right now?
We're going to have it right now.

1398
01:34:54,335 --> 01:34:55,185
Yeah, walk with me.

1399
01:34:55,967 --> 01:34:56,654
Ok.

1400
01:34:57,596 --> 01:34:59,057
I'm going to give you
the meeting of your life.

1401
01:34:59,059 --> 01:35:00,046
Your office.

1402
01:35:01,349 --> 01:35:03,129
Yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.

1403
01:35:04,561 --> 01:35:05,576
Absolutely, we're...

1404
01:35:06,477 --> 01:35:07,597
I'm going to have to call you back.

1405
01:35:08,315 --> 01:35:09,082
Mr. Stane?

1406
01:35:09,356 --> 01:35:09,913
Sir,

1407
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:13,362
we've explored what you've asked us,
and it seems as though there is a little hiccup.

1408
01:35:13,403 --> 01:35:15,113
Actually...
A hiccup?

1409
01:35:15,173 --> 01:35:16,466
Yes, to power the suit,

1410
01:35:17,190 --> 01:35:18,991
sir, the technology actually doesn't exist.

1411
01:35:19,201 --> 01:35:20,555
So it's... it's...
Wait, wait, wait.

1412
01:35:20,557 --> 01:35:21,623
The technology?

1413
01:35:22,454 --> 01:35:25,059
William, here is the technology.

1414
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:28,460
I've asked you to simply make it smaller.

1415
01:35:28,543 --> 01:35:30,527
Ok sir, that's what we're trying to do but,

1416
01:35:30,537 --> 01:35:32,491
honestly, it's impossible.

1417
01:35:32,589 --> 01:35:35,887
Tony Stark was able
to build this in a cave!

1418
01:35:37,248 --> 01:35:39,065
With a box of scraps!

1419
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:42,424
Well, I'm sorry.

1420
01:35:43,090 --> 01:35:44,628
I'm not Tony Stark.

1421
01:36:00,575 --> 01:36:01,575
<i>Tony?</i>

1422
01:36:04,371 --> 01:36:05,439
<i>Tony, are you there?</i>

1423
01:36:06,972 --> 01:36:07,796
<i>Hello?</i>

1424
01:36:09,154 --> 01:36:10,197
Breathe.

1425
01:36:11,586 --> 01:36:14,051
Easy, easy.

1426
01:36:16,425 --> 01:36:18,539
You remember this one, right?

1427
01:36:20,429 --> 01:36:22,632
It's a shame the government
didn't approve it.

1428
01:36:22,634 --> 01:36:26,807
There's so many applications
for causing short-term paralysis.

1429
01:36:29,186 --> 01:36:30,295
Tony.

1430
01:36:32,858 --> 01:36:33,958
When I...

1431
01:36:35,296 --> 01:36:37,193
ordered the hit on you,

1432
01:36:39,823 --> 01:36:42,032
I worried that I was...

1433
01:36:45,328 --> 01:36:47,330
killing the golden goose.

1434
01:36:48,707 --> 01:36:50,281
But you see,

1435
01:36:51,095 --> 01:36:52,426
it was just...

1436
01:36:53,795 --> 01:36:55,839
fate that you survived that.

1437
01:37:01,136 --> 01:37:04,956
You had one last golden egg to give.

1438
01:37:09,269 --> 01:37:12,800
Do you really think that just
because you have an idea,

1439
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:14,500
it belongs to you?

1440
01:37:18,382 --> 01:37:19,604
Your father,

1441
01:37:20,673 --> 01:37:23,513
he helped give us the atomic bomb.

1442
01:37:23,658 --> 01:37:27,606
Now, what kind of world would it be
today if he was as selfish as you?

1443
01:37:37,943 --> 01:37:39,395
Oh, it's beautiful.

1444
01:37:42,177 --> 01:37:43,436
Oh, Tony,

1445
01:37:45,062 --> 01:37:47,135
this is your Ninth Symphony.

1446
01:37:49,259 --> 01:37:51,678
What a masterpiece.
Look at that.

1447
01:37:53,105 --> 01:37:54,689
This is your legacy.

1448
01:37:57,401 --> 01:37:59,726
A new generation of weapons,

1449
01:38:00,712 --> 01:38:02,498
with this at its heart.

1450
01:38:05,867 --> 01:38:09,440
Weapons that will help steer
the world back on course,

1451
01:38:09,572 --> 01:38:11,567
put the balance of power in our hands.

1452
01:38:13,542 --> 01:38:14,880
The right hands.

1453
01:38:18,296 --> 01:38:20,011
I wish you could've seen...

1454
01:38:21,417 --> 01:38:22,876
my prototype.

1455
01:38:24,164 --> 01:38:25,336
It's not as...

1456
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:29,906
Well, not as conservative as yours.

1457
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:34,550
Too bad you had
to involve Pepper in this.

1458
01:38:35,315 --> 01:38:37,247
I would have preferred that she lived.

1459
01:38:50,954 --> 01:38:52,869
What do you mean,
he paid to have Tony killed?

1460
01:38:53,268 --> 01:38:54,252
Pepper, slow down.

1461
01:38:54,723 --> 01:38:56,053
Why would Obadiah...

1462
01:38:57,169 --> 01:38:58,462
Ok, where's Tony now?

1463
01:38:58,545 --> 01:39:00,182
I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.

1464
01:39:00,338 --> 01:39:02,591
Please go over there and
make sure everything's ok.

1465
01:39:02,632 --> 01:39:05,260
Thank you, Rhodey.
I know a shortcut.

1466
01:40:11,493 --> 01:40:12,493
Good boy.

1467
01:40:52,576 --> 01:40:53,576
Tony?

1468
01:40:56,329 --> 01:40:57,329
Tony?

1469
01:40:59,207 --> 01:41:00,207
Tony?

1470
01:41:02,454 --> 01:41:03,375
Tony?

1471
01:41:06,298 --> 01:41:07,158
Tony!

1472
01:41:09,551 --> 01:41:10,242
Tony!

1473
01:41:10,904 --> 01:41:11,616
You ok?

1474
01:41:12,220 --> 01:41:13,302
Where's Pepper?

1475
01:41:13,972 --> 01:41:15,849
She's fine.
She's with five agents.

1476
01:41:15,891 --> 01:41:17,435
They're about to arrest Obadiah.

1477
01:41:18,323 --> 01:41:19,676
That's not going to be enough.

1478
01:41:44,252 --> 01:41:45,628
Section 16.

1479
01:41:47,074 --> 01:41:48,478
Section 16.

1480
01:41:49,393 --> 01:41:50,589
There it is.

1481
01:41:59,267 --> 01:42:01,448
My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.

1482
01:42:02,827 --> 01:42:04,335
What's that?
It's, like, a little device?

1483
01:42:04,356 --> 01:42:05,774
It's, like, a thing that's
going to pick the lock?

1484
01:42:05,818 --> 01:42:07,258
You might want to take
a few steps back.

1485
01:42:27,129 --> 01:42:29,673
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

1486
01:42:29,756 --> 01:42:30,583
Not bad?

1487
01:42:31,669 --> 01:42:32,314
Let's do it.

1488
01:42:39,224 --> 01:42:40,928
You need me to do anything else?

1489
01:42:42,185 --> 01:42:43,529
<i>Keep the skies clear.</i>

1490
01:42:49,067 --> 01:42:50,030
Damn!

1491
01:42:58,452 --> 01:42:59,671
Next time, baby.

1492
01:43:30,233 --> 01:43:31,509
Looks like you were right.

1493
01:43:32,354 --> 01:43:33,823
He was building a suit.

1494
01:43:34,196 --> 01:43:35,654
I thought it'd be bigger.

1495
01:44:32,841 --> 01:44:34,981
How do you think the Mark One
chest piece is going to hold up?

1496
01:44:35,125 --> 01:44:37,463
<i>The suit's at 48%
power and falling, sir.</i>

1497
01:44:37,465 --> 01:44:40,134
<i>That chest piece was never
designed for sustained flight.</i>

1498
01:44:40,178 --> 01:44:41,430
Keep me posted.

1499
01:44:43,473 --> 01:44:44,474
<i>Pepper!</i>

1500
01:44:44,558 --> 01:44:46,059
Tony! Tony, are you ok?

1501
01:44:46,101 --> 01:44:47,602
<i>I'm fine. How are...</i>

1502
01:44:47,644 --> 01:44:49,604
Obadiah, he's gone insane!
<i>I know.</i>

1503
01:44:49,646 --> 01:44:51,440
<i>Listen, you'd better get out of there.</i>
He built a suit.

1504
01:44:51,593 --> 01:44:53,073
<i>Get out of there right now!</i>

1505
01:45:04,870 --> 01:45:06,606
<i>Where do you think you're going?</i>

1506
01:45:12,671 --> 01:45:15,335
<i>Your services are no longer required.</i>

1507
01:45:15,922 --> 01:45:17,121
<i>Stane!</i>

1508
01:45:42,532 --> 01:45:44,242
<i>I love this suit!</i>

1509
01:45:44,263 --> 01:45:45,221
<i>Put them down!</i>

1510
01:45:45,452 --> 01:45:47,443
<i>Collateral damage, Tony.</i>

1511
01:45:49,081 --> 01:45:50,560
Divert power to chest RT.

1512
01:45:59,864 --> 01:46:01,741
<i>Power reduced to 19%.</i>

1513
01:46:09,851 --> 01:46:10,851
<i>Lady!</i>

1514
01:46:12,854 --> 01:46:14,815
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

1515
01:46:36,962 --> 01:46:39,798
<i>For 30 years,
I've been holding you up!</i>

1516
01:46:44,386 --> 01:46:46,471
<i>I built this company from nothing!</i>

1517
01:46:49,057 --> 01:46:51,393
<i>Nothing is going to stand in my way.</i>

1518
01:46:57,899 --> 01:46:59,088
<i>Least of all...</i>

1519
01:46:59,566 --> 01:47:00,431
<i>you!</i>

1520
01:47:09,911 --> 01:47:11,408
<i>Impressive!</i>

1521
01:47:11,449 --> 01:47:13,434
<i>You've upgraded your armor!</i>

1522
01:47:13,665 --> 01:47:15,991
<i>I've made some
upgrades of my own!</i>

1523
01:47:24,801 --> 01:47:26,843
<i>Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.</i>

1524
01:47:26,845 --> 01:47:28,555
Duly noted. Take me to maximum altitude.

1525
01:47:28,597 --> 01:47:30,972
<i>With only 15% power,
the odds of reaching that...</i>

1526
01:47:30,974 --> 01:47:32,745
I know the math!
Do it!

1527
01:47:41,443 --> 01:47:42,921
Sir, you're not going to believe this.

1528
01:47:42,923 --> 01:47:43,780
That thing is back.

1529
01:47:43,820 --> 01:47:44,801
Get me Major Allen.

1530
01:47:44,803 --> 01:47:46,102
Scramble the jets!

1531
01:47:49,159 --> 01:47:51,969
Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.

1532
01:47:52,025 --> 01:47:52,739
Yes, sir.

1533
01:48:01,421 --> 01:48:03,382
<i>Thirteen percent power, sir.</i>
Climb!

1534
01:48:07,427 --> 01:48:09,137
<i>Eleven percent.</i>
Keep going!

1535
01:48:16,186 --> 01:48:18,313
<i>Seven percent power.</i>
Just leave it on the screen!

1536
01:48:18,389 --> 01:48:19,261
Stop telling me!

1537
01:48:29,658 --> 01:48:34,057
<i>You had a great idea, Tony, but my
suit is more advanced in every way!</i>

1538
01:48:34,728 --> 01:48:36,338
<i>How'd you solve the icing problem?</i>

1539
01:48:36,910 --> 01:48:38,034
<i>Icing problem?</i>

1540
01:48:40,669 --> 01:48:41,962
<i>Might want to look into it.</i>

1541
01:48:54,683 --> 01:48:55,683
<i>Two percent.</i>

1542
01:48:58,103 --> 01:49:00,336
<i>We are now running on
emergency backup power.</i>

1543
01:49:12,701 --> 01:49:14,074
Potts!
Tony!

1544
01:49:14,076 --> 01:49:16,074
Oh, my God, are you ok?

1545
01:49:16,204 --> 01:49:17,480
I'm almost out of power.

1546
01:49:17,482 --> 01:49:18,500
I've got to get out of this thing.

1547
01:49:18,627 --> 01:49:19,895
I'll be right there.

1548
01:49:20,459 --> 01:49:21,423
<i>Nice try!</i>

1549
01:49:34,139 --> 01:49:35,794
Weapons status?

1550
01:49:36,308 --> 01:49:38,593
<i>Repulsors offline.
Missiles offline.</i>

1551
01:49:42,773 --> 01:49:43,814
Flares!

1552
01:49:52,866 --> 01:49:54,785
<i>Very clever, Tony.</i>

1553
01:50:00,248 --> 01:50:01,111
Potts?

1554
01:50:01,826 --> 01:50:02,687
Tony!

1555
01:50:02,820 --> 01:50:03,570
This isn't working.

1556
01:50:03,572 --> 01:50:05,984
We're going to have to overload
the reactor and blast the roof.

1557
01:50:06,228 --> 01:50:07,646
Well, how are you going to do that?

1558
01:50:07,792 --> 01:50:09,039
You're going to do it.

1559
01:50:09,174 --> 01:50:11,635
<i>Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.</i>

1560
01:50:11,718 --> 01:50:13,218
When I get clear of the
roof, I'll let you know.

1561
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:15,207
You're going to hit the
master bypass button.

1562
01:50:15,707 --> 01:50:17,329
It's going to fry everything up here.

1563
01:50:19,434 --> 01:50:21,770
Ok. I'm going in now.

1564
01:50:21,812 --> 01:50:24,690
Make sure you wait till I clear
the roof. I'll buy you some time.

1565
01:50:34,616 --> 01:50:35,900
<i>This looks important!</i>

1566
01:50:57,264 --> 01:50:59,737
I never had a taste for this sort of thing,

1567
01:51:00,142 --> 01:51:01,610
but I must admit,

1568
01:51:02,148 --> 01:51:04,240
I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

1569
01:51:12,529 --> 01:51:14,865
You finally outdid yourself, Tony!

1570
01:51:17,409 --> 01:51:19,369
You'd have made your father proud!

1571
01:51:24,499 --> 01:51:26,600
It's ready, Tony!
Get off the roof!

1572
01:51:46,521 --> 01:51:47,689
Tony!

1573
01:51:49,024 --> 01:51:50,651
How ironic, Tony!

1574
01:51:52,608 --> 01:51:54,558
Trying to rid the world of weapons,

1575
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:57,474
you gave it its best one ever!

1576
01:51:57,616 --> 01:51:58,841
Pepper!

1577
01:51:58,843 --> 01:51:59,981
And now,

1578
01:52:01,570 --> 01:52:03,236
I'm going to kill you with it!

1579
01:52:06,675 --> 01:52:08,785
You ripped out my targeting system!

1580
01:52:09,002 --> 01:52:10,468
Time to hit the button!

1581
01:52:10,617 --> 01:52:12,237
You told me not to!

1582
01:52:12,631 --> 01:52:14,466
Hold still, you little prick!

1583
01:52:16,572 --> 01:52:17,661
Just do it!

1584
01:52:17,933 --> 01:52:19,250
You'll die!

1585
01:52:22,224 --> 01:52:23,474
Push it!

1586
01:53:21,324 --> 01:53:22,784
Tony!

1587
01:53:31,367 --> 01:53:33,909
<i>You've all received the official
statement of what occurred</i>

1588
01:53:33,911 --> 01:53:35,644
<i>at Stark Industries last night.</i>

1589
01:53:36,339 --> 01:53:40,720
<i>There have been unconfirmed reports
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned</i>

1590
01:53:40,969 --> 01:53:43,283
<i>and caused damage to the arc reactor.</i>

1591
01:53:44,306 --> 01:53:46,600
<i>Fortunately, a member of Tony
Stark's personal security staff...</i>

1592
01:53:46,641 --> 01:53:48,602
Iron Man. That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

1593
01:53:48,643 --> 01:53:50,226
I mean, it's not technically accurate.

1594
01:53:50,228 --> 01:53:52,079
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,

1595
01:53:52,397 --> 01:53:54,796
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

1596
01:53:55,087 --> 01:53:56,297
Here's your alibi.

1597
01:53:57,611 --> 01:53:58,584
Ok.

1598
01:53:58,779 --> 01:54:00,947
You were on your yacht.
Yeah.

1599
01:54:00,989 --> 01:54:03,200
We have port papers that put
you in Avalon all night,

1600
01:54:03,283 --> 01:54:05,003
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

1601
01:54:05,077 --> 01:54:08,205
See, I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me

1602
01:54:08,288 --> 01:54:09,956
alone on the island.

1603
01:54:11,326 --> 01:54:12,704
That's what happened.
Alright.

1604
01:54:12,751 --> 01:54:14,154
Just read it, word for word.

1605
01:54:16,734 --> 01:54:17,939
There's nothing about Stane here.

1606
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:20,038
That's being handled.

1607
01:54:20,486 --> 01:54:21,768
He's on vacation.

1608
01:54:22,552 --> 01:54:24,030
Small aircraft have such...

1609
01:54:24,032 --> 01:54:25,014
a poor safety record.

1610
01:54:25,097 --> 01:54:27,555
But what about the whole cover
story that it's a bodyguard?

1611
01:54:27,682 --> 01:54:30,105
He's my body... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

1612
01:54:30,558 --> 01:54:32,495
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark.

1613
01:54:33,021 --> 01:54:34,516
Just stick to the official statement,

1614
01:54:34,518 --> 01:54:36,044
and soon, this will all be behind you.

1615
01:54:37,109 --> 01:54:39,361
You've got 90 seconds.

1616
01:54:42,195 --> 01:54:43,390
Agent Coulson?

1617
01:54:44,574 --> 01:54:46,503
I just wanted to say thank you

1618
01:54:46,505 --> 01:54:48,607
very much for all of your help.

1619
01:54:49,068 --> 01:54:50,111
That's what we do.

1620
01:54:50,798 --> 01:54:52,030
You'll be hearing from us.

1621
01:54:52,374 --> 01:54:54,043
From the Strategic Homeland Int...

1622
01:54:54,045 --> 01:54:55,133
Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1623
01:54:56,044 --> 01:54:56,974
Right.

1624
01:54:58,213 --> 01:54:59,715
Let's get this show on the road.

1625
01:54:59,798 --> 01:55:02,175
You know, it's actually not that bad.

1626
01:55:02,217 --> 01:55:03,840
Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

1627
01:55:04,594 --> 01:55:06,069
You're not Iron Man.
I am.

1628
01:55:06,221 --> 01:55:07,735
You're not.
So. Alright, so...

1629
01:55:08,725 --> 01:55:10,349
You know, if I were Iron Man,

1630
01:55:10,351 --> 01:55:12,851
I'd have this girlfriend 
who knew my true identity.

1631
01:55:12,853 --> 01:55:14,394
She'd be a wreck, because
she'd always be worrying

1632
01:55:14,396 --> 01:55:15,280
that I was going to die,

1633
01:55:15,282 --> 01:55:17,938
yet so proud of the man I'd become.

1634
01:55:17,940 --> 01:55:18,543
She'd be...

1635
01:55:19,303 --> 01:55:21,670
wildly conflicted, 
which would only make her more

1636
01:55:23,467 --> 01:55:24,551
crazy about me.

1637
01:55:24,553 --> 01:55:25,867
Tell me you never think
about that night.

1638
01:55:26,283 --> 01:55:27,495
What night?
You know.

1639
01:55:31,079 --> 01:55:32,186
Are you talking about...

1640
01:55:32,985 --> 01:55:34,423
the night that we danced and...

1641
01:55:35,276 --> 01:55:36,791
went up on the roof and...

1642
01:55:38,462 --> 01:55:39,206
and then...

1643
01:55:40,742 --> 01:55:42,422
you went downstairs to...

1644
01:55:43,226 --> 01:55:45,070
get me a drink and you...

1645
01:55:45,876 --> 01:55:47,372
left me there, by myself?

1646
01:55:48,597 --> 01:55:49,987
Is that the night you're talking about?

1647
01:55:53,310 --> 01:55:54,310
Thought so.

1648
01:55:57,105 --> 01:56:00,684
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

1649
01:56:00,942 --> 01:56:02,781
<i>And now, Mr. Stark</i>

1650
01:56:02,783 --> 01:56:04,391
<i>has prepared a statement.</i>

1651
01:56:04,511 --> 01:56:06,493
<i>He will not be taking any questions.</i>

1652
01:56:06,643 --> 01:56:07,420
<i>Thank you.</i>

1653
01:56:11,828 --> 01:56:13,033
<i>Been a while since I was...</i>

1654
01:56:13,589 --> 01:56:15,636
<i>in front of you. I figure
I'll stick to the cards this time.</i>

1655
01:56:18,901 --> 01:56:21,741
<i>There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred</i>

1656
01:56:22,047 --> 01:56:23,472
<i>on the freeway and the rooftop...</i>

1657
01:56:23,474 --> 01:56:26,298
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that

1658
01:56:26,301 --> 01:56:27,871
that was a bodyguard in a suit,

1659
01:56:27,953 --> 01:56:29,979
that conveniently appeared,

1660
01:56:30,138 --> 01:56:32,727
despite the fact that you...
<i>I know that it's confusing.</i>

1661
01:56:33,238 --> 01:56:37,010
<i>It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely</i>

1662
01:56:37,020 --> 01:56:40,315
<i>to make wild accusations, or
insinuate that I'm a superhero.</i>

1663
01:56:40,357 --> 01:56:41,740
I never said you were a superhero.

1664
01:56:42,019 --> 01:56:42,677
<i>Didn't?</i>

1665
01:56:43,085 --> 01:56:45,405
<i>Well good, because 
that would be outlandish and...</i>

1666
01:56:46,664 --> 01:56:47,513
<i>fantastic.</i>

1667
01:56:49,366 --> 01:56:49,992
<i>I...</i>

1668
01:56:50,437 --> 01:56:52,819
<i>I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.</i>

1669
01:56:53,161 --> 01:56:54,244
<i>With this...</i>

1670
01:56:54,828 --> 01:56:56,308
<i>laundry list of character defects,</i>

1671
01:56:56,331 --> 01:56:57,515
<i>all the mistakes I've made,</i>

1672
01:56:57,663 --> 01:56:59,218
<i>largely public.</i>

1673
01:56:59,501 --> 01:57:01,128
Just stick to the cards, man.

1674
01:57:01,169 --> 01:57:02,629
Yeah, ok. Yeah.

1675
01:57:05,006 --> 01:57:05,944
<i>The truth is.</i>

1676
01:57:12,723 --> 01:57:13,877
<i>I am Iron Man.</i>

1678
02:05:17,361 --> 02:05:18,343
Jarvis!

1679
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:20,210
<i>Welcome home, sir.</i>

1680
02:05:23,922 --> 02:05:25,447
I am Iron Man.

1681
02:05:26,764 --> 02:05:29,208
You think you're 
the only superhero in the world?

1682
02:05:29,761 --> 02:05:32,732
Mr. Stark, you've become
part of a bigger universe.

1683
02:05:33,098 --> 02:05:34,995
You just don't know it yet.

1684
02:05:35,313 --> 02:05:36,381
Who the hell are you?

1685
02:05:37,352 --> 02:05:38,309
Nick Fury,

1686
02:05:38,553 --> 02:05:39,859
Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1687
02:05:42,187 --> 02:05:44,481
I'm here to talk to you about
the Avenger Initiative.
